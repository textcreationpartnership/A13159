            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If any Papiſt finde himſelfe agrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with my plaineneſſe; let him impute the fault to you alſo, that firſt began to ſtir theſe coales, and to the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of popiſh religion, that contain ſuch deepe matters of rebellion and treaſon; and not to me, that being thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked, haue ſo plainely reuealed them.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe vpon ſmall aduantages, you haue made great triumphes, and called your aduerſary forth to anſwere you, as it were in eight encounters; vanting and facing, as if you were to play your maiſters priſes: I haue taken vpon me to ioyne with you vpon your owne ground, and to try with you at your owne weapons, hoping to prooue you ignorant both of ſtate matters, wherein you pretend to know ſuch ſecrets, and alſo of ſound diuinitie, and other learning; of which your friends and your ſelfe make ſuch vants. For matters concerning Sir Francis Haſtings his owne perſon, I refer you to his owne anſwere, that may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſatisfie you. For the reſt I thought it not amiſſe to diſcourſe with you more at large.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe you goe about to carie away matters with faire pretenſes, as if you papiſts the popes children were the only catholikes, and did profeſſe the ancient faith of the catholike church, and as if all others were heretikes, and wrong beleeuers; I doe alſo vpon your lend gloſſes draw you out into fiue new encounters; wherein if you
<pb facs="tcp:177777:5"/> ward not the better, it ſhall be prooued, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that you are no catholikes, nor hold the catholike faith; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that your religion is a new deuiſe, and not the auncient reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Chriſts church; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that you are heretikes; <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that the Romiſh Church is the harlot of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, and not the true church of Chriſt. And laſtly, that your conſorts haue beene executed for treaſon moſt iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not for religion. Which being prooued, I truſt, your ſelfe will confeſſe, that wee haue iuſt cauſe to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that religion, that we profeſſe, and to withſtand anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, the Spaniard, and all their adherents, that goe about both by force and treaſon, to worke the deſtruction of her maieſtie and this ſtate; and all becauſe wee doe publikely maintaine this truth. And although you will not confeſſe it, that ſhut your eies againſt the light of truth; yet I hope all the world ſhall perceiue both the wrongs of the pope and Spaniard, and of your ſelfe and other rinegued Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, that adhere vnto them, and alſo the iuſtice of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that are forced ſometimes to take armes, and vſe our beſt meanes for the ſauegard of our countrey, our Prince, our wiues, our children, our libertie, our lawes, our friends, moſt violently and wickedly oppugned vnder the pretence of reſtoring Romiſh religion.</p>
                  <p>This diſcourſe it may pleaſe you to accept, as procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from him, that is deſirous to enforme you of a truth. And well can you not refuſe it, ſeeing it is an anſwere to your challenge, and containeth a reply to your eight tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous encounters, and your bold and ſhameleſſe petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Seeing you are come into the fielde, you may not refuſe to defend your ſelfe. Seeing you preſent vnto vs your petitions, and are become an humble ſutor at the court, you cannot refuſe your anſwere and diſpatch. I doe alſo deſire anſwere in my new encounters; and proteſt, that if you come not forth; you ſhall be baffuld for a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb facs="tcp:177777:6"/> vnwoorthie to beare armes in this kinde of warfare. If you be not at leyſure, by reaſon of your treaſonable nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations againſt your countrey, let Creſwell or ſome other trecherous babling Ieſuite ſtand foorth, and try his skill. It ſtandeth you much vpon. If you cannot without rayling, and calumniation make an anſwere; then I hope, that all ſuch, as you haue abuſed, will forſake you, as rayling here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, falſe teachers, and falſe traytors to your countrey; and that they will alſo abandon the new deuiſes, wicked here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and ſtrange religion which the popes and papiſts moſt wrongfully called catholikes, vnder the colour and falſe maske of catholike religion, and the catholike church, haue defended and maintayned. At the leaſt they will take heed, how they either runne wilfully into dangerous trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and rebellions, or ignorantly admit into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey forrein enimies vpon the popes warrant, or vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe of religion, which they are neuer able to maintaine, to be either ancient, or catholike, or true.</p>
                  <p>And this I thinke will ſufficiently cleare Sir Francis Haſtings both of adulation, and of calumniation, and all other odious imputations, which you haue layde to his charge: if not in your eies, nor iudgement; yet certes in the eies of all indifferent men. As for others, we neither force their might, nor weigh their malice. Let <hi>the ire of forrein princes be neuer ſo implacable,</hi> and <hi>courſe of home tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors neuer ſo deſperate,</hi> as you do threaten vs: we ſhall by the grace of God haue meanes to withſtand their force, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from notorious iniuſtice, and, I hope, that our ſuperiours according to lawes will encounter with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate courſes of traytors.</p>
                  <p>Doe you leaue your threats, and your facing, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and calumniations and raylings, and in a moderate courſe prepare your ſelfe to iuſtifie your chalenge, and with ſubſtance of matter to anſwere that, which we haue

                  <p>In the meane time, while you are buckling on your armes, I haue ſome words to ſpeake to the by ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or readers. Be not offended, I pray you.

                  <p>Nay they are lately growne ſo inſolent, that they dare not onely taxe and raile at religion, and gouernment, but alſo reuell at all thoſe, that once beginne to open their mouth in defence of the truth of her Maieſtie, of iuſtice, and of their countrie; and not onely that, but alſo preſume to offer their paltrie pamphlets to the view and conſideration of the Lordes of her Maiesties counſell, which are the chiefe maintainers of religion and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And that this is moſt true, we neede no further proofe, then a certaine treatiſe entituled a <hi>Wardeword,</hi> and written in outward ſhew againſt Sir Francis Haſtings, but in very truth againſt religion, and this gouernment.</p>
                  <p>This good Knight of a right zealous minde toward reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and a loyall and louing affection towardes her Maiestie and the ſtate, giueth the word to his countreymen, and ſtirreth vp ſuch as ſleepe in too much ſecuritie, to conſider the malice of the Pope, the preparations of the Spanyards, and the trecherie of Spaniolized papiſtes, that either at home or abroade enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine intelligence with them: and ſeeing forreine enemies ſeeke by force to take the crowne from her Maieſtie, and to
<pb facs="tcp:177777:9"/> ſubuert the ſtate, and to plant not onely falſe religion, but alſo an abſolute tyrannie in this land; he exhorteth all loyall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and true Engliſh willingly to aduenture their liues, and to ſpend their goodes in defence of their religion, prince and countrie. He aduiſeth alſo all true Christians diligently to watch, and to beware of the trecherous practiſes of priestes, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, rinegued Engliſh, and their conſortes, as meaning no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the ſubuerſion of religion and ſtate. In all which diſcourſe, what one ſentence can be noted vnwoorthie either a true Christian, or a loyall ſubiect, or a woorthie knight? Is it not lawfull to oppoſe himſelfe against publike enemies and traitors, and to ſhew his affection toward his prince and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie? Sure, this our counterfeit N.D. whoſe name Parſons the Ieſuite doth borrow, as he doth the name of Dolman other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, is very much offended, that either our knight ſhould open his mouth in defence of the ſtate, or offer himſelfe readie to reſist the publike enemies thereof. Nay further he aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Pope and Spaniard, and maintaineth the cauſe of knowne traitors, and raileth at all, that dare ſpeake any thing againſt them. Wherein I neede not note vnto you either his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious follie, that ſhewing himſelfe a profeſſed enemie of his prince and countrie, yet thinketh to obtaine fauour for his cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes the papiſtes at the princes handes, or their boldnes, that vaunt of this champion, when no man can like him, but must needes ſhew a diſlike of his prince and countrie, and bewray himſelfe to be an enemie to the ſtate. But I doe the rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port vnto you the ſumme of this mans pleading, that you may the better vnderſtand the boldneſſe and impudencie of this generation, and how through our owne remiſſeneſſe wee haue ſuffered them to grow to this height of inſolencie.</p>
                  <p>He appealeth to the Lordes of her Maiesties counſell; and I hope they will cenſure ſuch a rayling libeller and lewde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion according to his deſerts. My ſelfe alſo doe commende vnto them this whole cauſe, and doubt not, but they will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely
<pb facs="tcp:177777:10"/> conſider the pride of the enemie, and the neceſsitie of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: &amp; that all magistates &amp; good ſubiects wil concurre with them in this caſe. Clemencie and debonnairetie is very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable; but to ſuffer either Gods honor to be violated through idolatrie or ſuperstition, or the Chriſtian magiſtrates life or perſon to be endangered; or the commonwealth to be vndermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for want of due puniſhment of offenders, is not to be termed clemencie, but rather a remiſſeneſſe and diſſolution of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, neither well agreeing with religion, nor ciuill policie.<note n="l" place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 15.</note> Aſa king of Iudah is commended, <hi>for that his hart was vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right with the Lord al his daies:</hi> yet was it no ſmal blemiſh to him, <hi>that he put not downe the high places,</hi> where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had eſtabliſhed another worſhip, then that which the Lord had appointed.

                  <p>And becauſe he ſhall not complaine, that we refuſe any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different triall, I haue thought it not amiſſe, to vndertake his challenge, and to meete him at euery turne, and in euery en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,

And foraſmuch as vnder colour of religion our aduerſary would ſlily defend all attemptes and practiſes againſt this ſtate, I haue with my anſwere vnto this Noddy conioyned a breife diſcourſe, and in certaine new encounters, drawing him foorth into a new combat, prooued that popiſh religion, whereon he ſo much ſtandeth, as if it were catholike, and the old religion of Chriſts church, <hi>Is neither catholike, nor ancient, nor true religion;</hi> and finally, that neither the church of Rome is the true church of Chriſt, nor the popes agents and adherents, that haue beene executed for traytors, true ſubiectes or martyrs.

                        <hi>A hundred greeuances and wrongs not ſufferable,</hi> which they declared by the particulars. And yet none of thoſe concerned corruptions of doctrine.

                     <p>Secondly, where in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> time the people had the Scriptures taken from them in their mother toong, and liued in great ignorance of matters of ſaluation, as ſeldome being inſtructed in matters of religion; not onely the word of God began againe to be publikely read in Churches, but alſo more ſincerely expounded, then before: neither were any exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the knowledge of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the true adminiſtration of Chriſts Sacraments, which by the abominable maſſe had beene aboliſhed, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and Gods people made partakers both of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his body, and of the cup alſo; and withall, the true doctrine of Sacraments was publikely deliuered vnto the people of God.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Gods true worſhip was againe reſtored accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his moſt holy worde, and the practiſe of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church of Chriſt; which before that had beene moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully corrupted with popiſh traditions, and humane inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, the rodde of the oppreſſor by her peaceable gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was broken, and the fires quenched, that had burned ſo many innocents, and true martyrs; and the tortures remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, wherewith many honeſt men had beene greeuouſly afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and peace was giuen to the church, ſo that all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians might without feare make profeſſion of their faith, and publikely meete to celebrate the name of God. Thoſe that were exiled returned, and ſuch true Chriſtians as kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſecret, did manifeſtly ſhew themſelues.</p>
                     <p>Finally, ſhée did not onely reſtore true religion, and the right adminiſtration of Sacraments, and Gods true worſhip, but alſo aboliſhed the manifold hereſies and corruptions of popiſh doctrine.

Well, this abuſiue foundation is nowe diſcouered, and we are taught to builde, not on pope, nor on friers, nor on legends nor lies, nor vncertaine traditions; but vpon the word of God. Now alſo by her Maieſties authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the moſt blaſphemous and idolatrous ſacrifice, and ſeruice of the maſſe, and the prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> with their Balaamiticall friers are remooued out of the church. The ſame is alſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of idols and idolatrie, and men from worſhipping of ſtockes and ſtones, and rotten ragges and bones, and from adoration of angels and men departed this life, are brought to worſhip the true and euerliuing God. Finally where héereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men were taught to ſéeke remiſſion of ſinnes by maſſes, indulgences, iubileies, holy water, and other humane deuiſes; and beléeued, that if they had not remiſſion héere, they ſhoulde at the leaſt finde it in purgatorie: nowe theſe abuſes were quite remooued, and men taught, that Chriſt Ieſus without theſe ceremonies was the onely way to heauen; and that Chriſtians obteined remiſſion of ſinnes by faith in him; and that no workes pleaſed God, but ſuch as he commanded. This then is the firſt and principall bleſſing which by her Maieſties moſt happie gouernment this land enioieth; a bleſſing I ſaie farre excelling all others, as farre as ſpirituall and eternall happineſſe excelleth temporall commodities. And yet, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péereth by the confeſſion of ſtrangers, that woondred at the happineſſe and tranquillitie of this ſtate in the troubles, and turmoiles of all our neighbors round about vs, God hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated vpon this people of England, by the meanes of her gouernment, diuers temporall bleſſings alſo.</p>
                     <p>Wée are therefore ſecondly to conſider, what temporall graces we haue obteined by meanes of her happy attaining to the crowne, and by her gouernment, albeit I make no doubt,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:177777:16"/> but that all theſe latter graces do flow from the firſt, as from a fountaine. For God ſaith<note n="a" place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.</note> expreſly, <hi>That he will honor thoſe, that honour him:</hi> and experience teacheth vs, that God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thoſe nations, which giue harbor to his church, and with a true hart receiue his worde, and ſerue him duly according to the ſame. Firſt then we may remember, that by her meanes we were deliuered from the thraldome of the Spaniard, and the feare of forraine lords, into which dangerous ſtate Quéene <hi>Marie</hi> with her poperie had brought this lande. Now how great a bleſſing this is, we may eaſily vnderſtand, if we do but looke either into the miſerable bondage of our neighbours of the low Countries, or elſe of the Spaniards themſelues. And better then theſe we coulde not hope for; but many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might mooue vs to feare woorſe, of which we ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake héereafter.

Since that time all the priuileges of the countrey haue béene broken, and ſuch intollerable wrongs offered, and impoſitions and taxes laide vpon them, that the moſt aboundant countrey in Europe is now conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and brought to nothing. In Spaine the people liueth in excéeding feare of the Inquiſition, and paieth the tenth of all things bought and ſold in the market, and beſide that diuers cuſtomes, and whatſoeuer burthens or impoſitions elſe the Princes can with any colour lay vpon them. So that nowe notwithſtanding the riches of the Indies, the people of Spain for the moſt part are brought to beggerie.</p>
                     <p>Secondly by the aboliſhing of the popes vſurped power, his extreme exactions ceaſed, and the publike treaſure of the kingdome, which by his meanes was woont to be exhauſted, began to encreaſe; at the leaſt it was kept within the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly her Maieſtie reſtored peace vnto vs, which Quéene <hi>Marie</hi> intricating her-ſelfe in her huſbands quarrell, did exchange for warres, and loſt Calice, and all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of her anceſtors poſſeſſions in France. This peace, but that the papiſts haue gone about by diuers attempts at home
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:177777:17"/> and abroade to trouble it, hath now continued two and fortie yeeres and vpward. So it appéereth what troubles, wants, warres, rebellions, loſſes, or diſgraces haue hapned now this many yéeres to this nation, or elſe are intended againſt vs, that the ſame haue wholy procéeded from the popiſh faction, and their abominable and curſed idolatrie and ſuperſtition, as all bleſſings that haue béene beſtowed vpon vs, haue iſſued from the fountaine of Gods fauour for the maintenance of his truth, by meanes of her Maieſties gracious gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of her fathers and her brothers noble purpoſes and deſeignements. Neither did her Maieſtie reſtore peace to vs, onely with forreine enimies, but reſtraine the cruell rage of popiſh butchers that murdered Gods ſaints at home, &amp; made warres vpon them. ſhée, I ſay, reſtored peace, and gaue reſt to Gods church.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly by meanes of her Maieſties gouernement, the ſtrength of this land is growne great. Neuer were there more valiant men of warre, nor better men at ſea, then now. Her Nauie is excéedingly encreaſed: her munitions and furniture for the war is exceeding. Neuer was there in England greater ſtore of learned men, nor more cunning artificers in al trades. There is no countrey better peopled: nor was euer prince more reuerenced, or beloued of her ſubiects.</p>
                     <p>Theſe bleſſings God hath beſtowed on her people by meanes of her gouernment. It hath pleaſed him alſo ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bleſſe her both with ſpirituall, and temporall graces; and to make her reigne farre longer, then of moſt of her progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, &amp; to multiplie her daies aboue ordinarie. Shee hath alſo ſeene the miſerable endes of moſt of her enimies, and of ſuch traitors, as haue ſought her hurt; and long may ſhée continue, and ſee the confuſion of the reſt, to the comfort of all her louing ſubiects, and griefe of her wicked enimies. As for thoſe, that haue either by open force, or priuate practiſe ſought to deſtroie her, they are all periſhed, and come to confuſion: euen ſo Lord let them all periſh, and come to confuſion, that hate thée, and thy truth, and the maintainers and profeſſors thereof.</p>
                     <p>At this happineſſe of the Engliſh nation, by the happie change of religion made by her Maieſtie at her firſt entrance into her kingdome, it is no maruell, if this our aduerſarie, and his conſorts be repine: for that is the nature of enuie, to bée

Beſide this, if anie calamitie did procéed from this alteration of religion, then
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:177777:19"/> ſhould her Maieſtie deſerue moſt blame, by whoſe authoritie the ſame was wrought and procured: and ſo ſhould this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that would ſo willingly inſinuate himſelfe into her fauor, ſpill all fauour, by imputing to her all our pretended feares and calamities. To cléere himſelfe he ſaith, <hi>That this alteration did not proceed from her owne inclination at the firſt.</hi> But while he would ſéeme to excuſe her, he doth gréeuouſly accuſe her, as if ſhée had done contrarie to her owne inclination, and had by chance, as it were, and without any knowledge or firme reſolution entred this courſe. He doth alſo depriue her of the moſt principall part of all her glorie, which roſe eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vpon her zeale in reforming religion. Further he telleth a moſt ſhameleſſe vntruth. for who knoweth not, that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of religion did wholy proceede from her owne moſt earneſt zeale? did not ſhée her ſelfe, when any difficulties were ſurmiſed vpon this alteration, neglect them all? was ſhée not alwaies taken for a profeſſor of Gods truth? was not this the onely cauſe of <hi>Wincheſters,</hi> and all the papiſts hatred and practiſes againſt her? finally, where he would gladly yéeld her Maieſtie ſome praiſe for her good inclination, he doth like a noddie diſpraiſe her, and charge her to haue wrought that, <hi>Which all true affected men may rue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to paſſe ouer his follie, and vndutifull behauiour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his prince, to whom he oweth all honor and reuerence, &amp; yéeldeth none; that which he talketh of our eſtate, which he imagineth to be miſerable &amp; ruthfull, deſerueth more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For gladly would he worke a diſlike of the preſent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in mens mindes; and principally he deſireth men ſhoulde beléeue, that all ſuppoſed dangers procéed from the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of religion at her Maieſties firſt comming to the crowne. But for the firſt, the ſtate of things themſelues will anſwere. Lawes are ordinarily executed, no man is wronged either in his perſon, or his lands, or his goods, but he may haue remedie. Religion is truely preached &amp; profeſſed: and if any complaine, it is bicauſe ſuch malcontentes, as miſlike, &amp; oppugne the gouernment, are too much fauoured. Againſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine enimies we want neither meanes nor courage to reſiſt. And if nothing would mooue vs to like the ſtate preſent, yet the malice of traitors, and enuie which they beare againſt it, may perſwade vs, that it is well founded and ſetled. For if it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:177777:19"/> were otherwiſe, they woulde then as much reioice, as now they ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond we ſay, that howſoeuer we ſtand, true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is neither the cauſe of trouble, nor of danger. For if that were ſo, then were all princes and ſtates, that profeſſe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the ſame caſe. Againe, then ſhould all that enioy popiſh religion enioy peace alſo &amp; proſperitie: which experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs to be moſt vntrue. For the Portugals albeit extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily popiſh, yet are oppreſſed by the tyrannie of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, and the popiſh prouinces of the low Countries liue in great ſlauerie. The French king <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his deuotion to the pope, was in the end excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, vexed with rebellions, &amp; moſt ſhamefully murdred by a Dominican frier. <hi>Don Caeſare d'eſte</hi> duke of Ferrara was not, I trow, of our religion; yet did the pope excommunicate him, and moſt wrongfully take his ſtate from him. Laſtly, if religion now profeſſed were the immediate cauſe and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of any trouble like to enſue; then ſhould not the papiſtes haue béene the principall meanes to mooue warres, and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions againſt the ſtate, nor the onely practiſers againſt her Maieſties perſon and ſafetie, as we haue found them to haue béene. Wherefore, if we will rightly eſtéeme, we ſhall finde, that as true religion is the cauſe of all thoſe bleſſings we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy: ſo poperie, and the faction that maintaineth it, is the cauſe of all practiſes againſt her Maieſtie and the ſtate, and of all rebellions, and warres, and miſchiefes entended againſt vs. Againe, as we were without danger, as long as God was truely worſhipped, and idolatrie repreſſed, and Ieſuites and prieſts, and their abettors diligently ſought out, and puniſhed according to lawes, and all concurred reſolutely to maintaine true religion and the ſtate: ſo ſince Recuſants began of ſome to finde fauour; and maſſe-prieſts and Ieſuites haue béene ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to practiſe without puniſhment, and idolatrie is begun to be priuily erected, and ſome mens mindes grow colde in maintaining true religion, and the preſent gouernment; it is no maruell, if ſome inconuenience be feared. But remooue this, there is no cauſe, why any ſhoulde either doubt, or feare. For the pope hath buſineſſe inough to maintaine his owne ſtate; &amp; no meanes to worke vs trouble, but by Engliſh trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. In times paſt he was <hi>Stupor mundi,</hi> the woonderment
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:177777:20"/> of the world; now he is <hi>Fabula mundi,</hi> that is, a matter for idle prieſts and friers to prate of, but not to be feared, vnleſſe wée liſte. The Spaniard hath more reaſon to feare vs, and our aſſociates of the low Countries, that may be lordes of the ſea, if we pleaſe, and may take what part of the Indies we liſt; then we to feare him. Sure if his force had béene ſuch as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, neuer would he haue ſuffred ſuch ſcorne, nor deſcended to ſuch diſhonorable courſes, as he hath done. Both the pope and Spaniard depend vpon the aide of Engliſh fugitiues and malcontents. Draw from them this hope, then haue you the end of theſe ſuppoſed feares, and a full anſwere to this traitors painted tales and fables.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee this noddy hath neither reaſon, nor truth in his diſcourſe. And yet that is not all the fault it hath. For it is alſo impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the purpoſe. For what if there were ſome cauſe of feare, or doubt? doth it therefore follow, that we haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued no benefits, nor bleſſings by her Maieſties moſt happie gouernment, &amp; the aboliſhment of idolatrie, and reſtoring of true and catholike religion? If then there be no iuſt cauſe of feare, and onely certaine puſillanimous companions, quake at the popes thundring, and Spaniſh bragging, or elſe pretend to do it, bicauſe they looke backe to the fleſhpots of Egypt, and glory of Babylon; then are we to acknowledge Gods fauour, that hath not onely giuen vs many graces by her Maieſties meanes, but alſo meanes to maintaine them, and to ſecure our ſelues. And for ſuch cowards as feare forreine enimies, we are to put them into the next ranke to Engliſh traitors alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die conſpired with the enimie,</p>
                     <p>Hée telleth vs further, <hi>That by alteration of religion in England; Scotland, Ireland, Flanders, and France, haue taſted of many miſeries, tumults, calamities, and deſolations.</hi> Hée ſhould haue ſaid of many bleſſings, and friendly fauors. For kindneſſes and fauours, all our neighbors haue receiued from vs: but thoſe calamities and deſolations that he ſpeaketh of, haue procéeded from the popes furie and malice, and from his adherents, perſecuting quiet people for the profeſſion of true Chriſtian religion. But let vs heare the reſt of his wiſe tale.</p>

                        <hi>Beſide battels, murders, deſtructions of countries, prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, townes, cities, houſes, and particular men,</hi> ſaith hée, <hi>three
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:177777:20"/> Princes, two Queenes, and one King, haue beene all brought to their bane, by this occaſion.</hi> He ſaith further, <hi>That the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble houſes and linages of Hamiltons, Douglaſſes, Stuardes in Scotland, of Deſmondes and other peeres in Ireland, haue been thereby ruinated:</hi> and finally, <hi>That in France and Flanders, there is no end of the accompt of thoſe, that haue beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied by this change of religion:</hi> as if we had procured all theſe battels, murders, deſtructions; or as if wée, or our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, were the occaſion of the deſtruction of princes or kings; or as if the maſſacres of France, and thoſe bloodie executions, had béene committed by vs. What a ſhameleſſe fellow is this to impute the cauſe of warres and troubles to vs, that euer auoided warres as much as we could, and offered force to no man, nor euer ſtirred, but as defendants for ſauegard of our liues? Are lambes the cauſes of the crueltie of wolues? or were Chriſtians the authors of the bloodie perſecutions of heathen Emperors? all theſe bigge wordes therefore are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but arguments of the Noddies diſtracted mind, and furious hatred againſt truth, that exclameth and crieth out vpon religion, and imputeth al calamities vnto it, whereas in truth all the cauſe of this wracke and deſtruction both of ſtates and priuate families, proceeded wholy from want of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and hatred of true religion. For if wee will looke backe, and ſearch the hiſtories of our times, wée ſhall finde, that all thoſe tragicall ſtirres, and hurly-burlies, that haue brought not onely millions of chriſtians, but alſo a great part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome to deſtruction, haue taken their beginning from the implacable hatred of popes and papiſts againſt Chriſtian religion. <hi>Paule</hi> the third enflamed the warres againſt the princes of Germanie, which conſumed a great part of that countrey: himſelfe ſent thither great forces, both of horſe and foote, fearing not a little, leaſt <hi>Charles</hi> the fift ſhould make any compoſition with the Germans.</p>
                     <p>In the low Countries the people liued in peace and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their gouernours, vntill ſuch time as the popiſh facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, fearing the ruine of their <hi>Babylon,</hi> beganne not onely to make cruell edicts and decrées againſt the profeſſors of true religion, but alſo by force of armes ſought to eſtabliſh both the Spaniſh inquiſition, and an abſolute tyrannie.</p>

                        <hi>Pius</hi> the fift, when the kings of France and Spaine
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:177777:21"/> grew wery of troubles, ſent his meſſengers to negotiate with king <hi>Philip,</hi> and the Cardinall of Alexandria, to ſet forward the French king againſt his ſubiects. He ſent alſo money and ſoldiers to aide the king, to deſtroy his ſubiects.</p>

                     <p>By the ſolicitation of the popes agents, many thouſands of innocent people were maſſacred in France, contrarie to faith, and promiſe. Theſe therefore are the murderers, and maſſacrers of Gods ſaints: theſe are they which haue occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the ruine of diuers noble houſes &amp; perſonages. In Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land the erles of Weſtmerland and Northumberland har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening to the ſeditious motions of the pope ruined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, &amp; their houſes. By the ſame occaſion the houſe of Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, and other houſes in Ireland were ouerthrowne. Why the ruine of theſe houſes and men ſhould be imputed to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is not any colour. In Scotland the houſes and lina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the <hi>Hamiltons, Douglaſſes,</hi> and <hi>Stuardes</hi> do yet ſtand, and if any of theſe houſes haue runne headlong into their owne deſtruction, it is no fault of ours.</p>
                     <p>The Quéene <hi>Douager</hi> of Scotland, that was ſiſter to the Duke of Guiſe died of ſickneſſe. How the laſt Quéene came to her end, I report me to publike actes and hiſtories. Her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was not ſlaine by men of our ſide, but of theirs: not for matter of religion, but for other cauſes. Our aduerſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dealeth abſurdly and like himſelfe, that imputeth the faults of Popiſh religion, that teacheth murder of chriſtians, depoſing of princes, ſubuerſion of ſtates and kingdomes, and all manner of perfidious and cruell dealing, to vs. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome error had béene committed in France, and the lowe countries, why is the ſame mentioned here, where we diſpute about matters in England? can he not content himſelfe to vtter vntruthes, but he muſt alſo ſpeake impertinently, and ſo far from the purpoſe?</p>
                     <p>To amend the matter, he deuideth all bleſſings into ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and temporall, and denyeth that by change of religion we haue receiued either the one, or the other. For <hi>before this alteration,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>one God was adored not onely in England,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:177777:21"/> but alſo throughout all Chriſtendome, and after one manner.</hi> He ſaith further, <hi>That there was one faith, one beleefe, one forme of ſeruice, one number of ſacraments, one tongue in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration, one ſacrifice, one head of the church, one obedience, one iudgement, in time paſt; and that now all is altered, the people of England being diuided not onely from the reſt of catholikes, but alſo from Lutherans, Zuinglians, Caluiniſts abroad, and among themſelues at home.</hi> But dealing with an aduerſarie, and in matter ſo controuerſious, if hée had beene wiſe, hée woulde haue brought either better proofes, or more modeſtie. To lie notoriouſly, muſt néedes worke diſcredite to his cauſe. Firſt moſt vntrue it is, that before this alteration one God was worſhipped throughout all Chriſtendome, and after one manner. For to ſpeake truely, the moſt part of thoſe, that called themſelues Chriſtians, liued without all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, or of Chriſt Ieſus, hauing nothing of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, but the very name, and the outwarde Sacrament of Baptiſme. The reſt, ſome fewe onely excepted, whom God enlightened with more knowledge, for God, worſhipped an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and ſaints, and the bleſſed virgine.

For not onely the Gréeke liturgie doth much differ from the Latin, but alſo the Latin liturgies doe much differ from themſelues, and were ſo full of abuſes, that the Councell of Trent aboliſhing a number of old miſſals and portuiſes, was conſtrained to make new, and yet all naught, being nothing like the liturgies of the apoſtolike church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Iuſtin</hi> martyr, <hi>Dionyſe</hi> of Athens, and diuers other fathers. For thoſe of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> S. <hi>Baſill</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> are plainly counterfeited.</p>
                     <p>The number of <hi>7.</hi> ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts was not certainly eſtabliſhed nor receiued before the late councell of Trent. In the<note n="a" place="margin">C. firmiter. de ſum. trin. &amp; ſide cath.</note> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Lateran vnder pope <hi>Innocent</hi> there is mention made onely of two Sacraments, which we reteine. In no ancient father, that treateth of Sacraments can this number of ſeuen be found. The apoſtles deliuered vs but onely two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that is of Baptiſme and the Lords ſupper.</p>
                     <p>In ancient time it was neuer thought vnlawfull to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate diuine ſeruice in any toong vnderſtoode of the people. The Greekes euen to this day reteine the Gréeke toong. The<note n="b" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</note> apoſtle doth directly condemne toongs vſed in diuine praiers or praiſes, if they be not vnderſtood of the people.</p>
                     <p>The popiſh ſacrifice of the maſſe, and all that abomination was not knowne of the ancient fathers, nor inſtituted by Chriſt. Then all Chriſtians did communicate, and receiue both kindes, and were otherwiſe taught, then now they are. The Gréeke churches alſo much differ from the church of Rome: and diuers formes of ſacrifices haue beene vſed in this church, vntil of late the Councell of Trent went about to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh an vniformitie, or rather difformitie of religion.</p>
                     <p>Finally as the popes headſhip is now denied of the eaſterne churches, and ſo was for many ages; ſo was the ancient church vtterly ignorant of the matter. If this Noddy will perſiſt in his error, and mainteine the contrarie; let him ſhew, if he can, that in ancient time the biſhops of Rome made lawes to binde the whole church, and were ſupreme iudges, and not iudged of others, and made biſhops throughout the world, and had that authoritie to diſpenſe, and pardon which now the pope craueth.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly where he ſaith, <hi>Wee are diuided not onely from the generall body of catholikes in Chriſtendome, but

Nay wée offer to prooue, that the papiſts haue by their nouelties and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies deuided themſelues from the catholike church; and ſay, that therefore wée haue left them, that wée may returne to the ancient apoſtolike and catholike church, and catholike faith of Chriſt. Secondly the churches of Zuizzerland, Germanie, France and England do neither holde of <hi>Zuinglius, Caluin,</hi> nor <hi>Luther,</hi> nor pope of Rome, as do the blind papiſts, but of Chriſt Ieſus, and of the apoſtles, and prophets. Neither do they diſagrée among themſelues. Nay the contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> is not ſo great, but that popiſh doctors haue greater. As for our ſelues, all of vs profeſſe the doctrine of Chriſt Ieſus according to that rule, that was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by common conſent of the church of England: from which if any digreſſe, he is no more to be accounted of our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie then the papiſts, that are of the popes retinue.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly he doth vs wrong where he ſaith, <hi>That our doctrine is diuers from the catholike faith of Chriſtendome.</hi> For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer Chriſt or his apoſtles taught, or is deliuered in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of faith or créedes generally receiued of Chriſts Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church, that wée beléeue and receiue, refuſing no point of catholike doctrine: and all priuate fancies, opinions, &amp; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, whether of popes, or other heretikes, and falſe teachers, we renounce, condemne, and anathematize.</p>
                     <p>Héereof it followeth, that the doctrine and faith of the church of England is moſt catholike and certaine, being grounded vpon the apoſtles, and prophets, Chriſt Ieſus being the corner ſtone; which is a firme rocke againſt which the gates of hell cannot preuaile. Grounded it is, I ſay, vpon the writings of the apoſtles and prophets, endited by Gods holie ſpirite, and thereunto not onely Councels and fathers, but alſo the aduerſaries themſelues, for the moſt part, giue teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie. But the blinde papiſts haue deuiſed and receiued both new grounds, of their religion, and new doctrine, which ſtandeth onely vpon the authoritie of this pope, and that pope, whoſe fancie and opinion is all the certeintie they haue.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:177777:25"/> This is that rocke, or rather banke of ſand, whereon the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable papiſts faith is built.

Truſting to the popes deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from the Angelickes, they haue receiued the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of angels; from the Collyridians, the worſhip of the holy virgin <hi>Marie;</hi> from the Carpocratians, and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and their diſciples, the worſhip of images; from the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chées and other heretikes, prohibition of meates, and diſlike of mariage of prieſts; and from other heretikes, other dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable opinions.

                           <hi>P.</hi> 6.</note> ſaith this Noddie, <hi>Why ſhould you beleeue more your owne opinions, then Caluin concerning the Queenes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, Luther concerning the reall preſence, and Beza in the church gouernment?</hi> I anſwere firſt, that theſe mens pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate opinions concerne not fundamentall points of faith. And therefore that they are not to bée brought foorth for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in this cauſe, where we talke of the foundations, &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Chriſtian faith. Secondly I deny that <hi>Caluin</hi> did deny the Quéenes ſupremacie in eccleſiaſticall matters, as we hold it. For neither did he ſubiect princes to popes or prieſts in matter of their royall gouernment, nor did hee denie princes power to eſtabliſh eccleſiaſticall lawes, nor to command for Gods truth, or to prouide for the ſetting foorth of true religion, or redreſſing of diſorders in churches or prieſts; which are the principall points of ſupreme gouernment of princes in their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:177777:26"/> realmes and dominions. Neither do I thinke, that any anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent father of the church did euer denie this power to princes. Sure I am, that many haue allowed it. The reaſon why <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi> did once miſlike the title of king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hée was perſwaded, that hee had challenged all that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, which the pope arrogateth to himſelfe, as head of the church: wherein after that he was better informed, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his ſtile, and retracted his opinion. Thirdly I ſay we ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend our opinion, and giue no approbation to <hi>Luthers</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the carnall preſence of Chriſts body in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, for that we ſée that doctrine to be new, &amp; not taught by the apoſtolike church. Nay we finde it to be repugnant to the apoſtles doctrine deliuered in Scriptures, to the doctrine of the ancient catholike church, and to the analogie of faith. Laſtly I ſay, that in external gouernment it is not neceſſarie, that all churches ſhould concur and agrée, ſéeing not onely the eaſt churches differed from the weſt, but the weſtern churches alſo from themſelues.

                        <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his church at Milan thought it not neceſſary in al things to follow the church of Rome.

Now what aſſurance the papiſts can haue of their faith, that haue no ground, but in the determination of the pope, I report me euen to the papiſts themſelues, that condemne priuate opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſinguler mens fancies, and in externall termes yéeld all, not to this man, or that man, but to the iudgement of Chriſt his vniuerſall church.</p>

                        <hi>Agrippa,</hi> are woont to ſet out thrée or fower women to hire, for encreaſe of their reuenues.</p>
                     <p>Is it not maruell then, that theſe fellowes are not aſhamed to talke of mortification of the fleſh, penance and continency, when they wallow in ſuch filthineſſe, and commit ſuch abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, as with modeſtie may not be named?</p>
                     <p>The papiſts alſo praie, and do almeſdéeds: but ſure they haue no reaſon to proclaime them. For vnder colour of their praiers, the monkes and friers deuour the houſes of widowes and orphanes. Nay ſimple people praie they know not what, and call vpon mortall men, that cannot helpe; and before ſtockes and ſtones, that cannot heare. Beſides that, their almeſdéedes being beſtowed vpon monks and friers, that liue in all licentiouſneſſe and voluptuouſneſſe, and are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the onely practiſers either to ouerthrow princes and their ſtates, or elſe to bring them in ſlauerie of Antichriſt, are woorthie no reward.</p>
                     <p>Neither do papiſts either kéepe better houſes, or take leſſe fines, or vſe leſſe ſwearing &amp; forſwearing, then other men. For with vs moſt of them breake vp houſes, and binde their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants to as great inconueniences, as any men. Now of their othes to their princes and others, they cannot make any
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:177777:28"/> great reckoning, when they are taught, that othes to princes binde no longer, then it pleaſeth the pope; and in ſo manie places haue rebelled againſt their lawfull magiſtrates.</p>
                     <p>The Noddy hée braggeth alſo of marying poore mens daughters. But yet is not able to tell of ſo many maried, as diſhoneſted by popiſh prieſts, and papiſts. Now if he pleaſe to name the one, he ſhall heare the names of the other.</p>
                     <p>Moſt abſurdly alſo doth hée take on him to talke of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, mortification of the fleſh and faſting, when popiſh pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is nothing, but externall puniſhment conſiſting for the moſt part in laſhing of the bodie, and other workes either ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarilie performed, or by the prieſt enioined. Neither is their mortification of the fleſh any thing, but hard lying, going, as they call it, woolward, wearing haire-cloth, and ſuch like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the body. Faſting likewiſe with them is nothing but eating of fiſh. But ſuch penance, ſuch mortification, ſuch faſting is no where enioined. Beſides that, Chriſt no where commandeth any to forſweare mariage, or to kéepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues virgins, but ſuch as haue the gift thereof. Neither doth hée command any to giue away his goods, and créepe into a monaſterie. Nor may wée thinke, that they renounce the world, or embrace pouertie, that as the Ieſuits, and other fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do liue in goodly palaces, and haue all things which they wanted before in great abundance. If this were the way to heauen, the way thither were verie plaine and large, and moſt pleaſant and eaſie.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore if wée may iudge thoſe to be bleſſed of God, that liue according to true religion; and thoſe vnhappie, whoſe actions are fierce and cruell, whoſe liues are filthy and abominable, and farre diſagréeing from the truth of Chriſtian pietie: then wee haue reaſon to lament the damnable eſtate of papiſts; and to reioice, that God hath giuen vs better grace, then to follow them in their filthineſſe, ſauage cruelties, and notorious impieties. Our aduerſarie ſaith <hi>He hath touched before the bloody tragedies raiſed in France, Flanders, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and might adde Swizzerland and Germany, where aboue a hundred thouſand were ſlaine in one yeere, in the rebellion of the countreymen againſt the lords about religion.</hi> But the more hée toucheth theſe matters, the more ſhame hee ſhall bring vpon himſelfe, and the ſynagogue of Rome. For not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:177777:29"/> any of our communion, but the cruell popes of Rome and their agentes haue cauſed theſe tragedies. They ſtirred vp the French King &amp; Spaniard to make wars vpon their quiet ſubiects, that deſired nothing but peace. Nay when a ſolemne peace was concluded, they made that a trappe to catch a number of noble men, and others, to murder them. True chriſtians haue ſtill ſuffered: and yet this ſauage companion imputeth vnto them the tragicall murders committed by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes. In Scotland the people neuer ſtirred before their liues were ſought: the inſurrection of the ruſticall people in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was for<note n="a" place="margin">Sleidan.</note> gréeuances offered them by their Lords, and not properly for religion. They were not of our religion but roſe againſt lords as well of our religion, as papiſts; and by our ſide were both by word, and force ſuppreſſed. But the warres in Bohemia, and Germanie, and Swizzerland, were indéede raiſed by the popes and their agents, and all the worlde ſéeth that all their ſtudie is to raiſe warres and tumults, &amp; to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all Chriſtendome. And yet Chriſtian princes will not ſée; neither will Chriſtian people beware of ſuch vnchriſtian courſes. As for the people of England, they are to ſhewe themſelues thankfull, not onely for the reſtoring of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but alſo for the fruite, that hath thereof enſued in all true religious Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>After his talke of ſpirituall bleſſings, hée paſſeth to ſpeake of temporall benefits, and ſaith, that <hi>If her Maieſtie, as ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by generall conſent, and was promoted by the forces of papiſts eſpecially, and ſhewed herſelfe in all points of religion and behauiour a papiſt, and was crowned at a maſſe, ſo had continued, then had ſhee and her realme beene moſt happy, and firſt ſhoulde haue had a moſt floriſhing kingdome vnited both to her, and among themſelues in religion, iudgement, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, fidelitie and friendſhip.</hi> But his tale conſiſteth of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers foule leaſinges, and his coniecture is vaine and improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For albeit ſhée entred with conſent of all good men, yet it gréeued the papiſts excéedingly, inſomuch that ſhée could not get any one popiſh prelate to execute the ceremonie of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration but onely one, and hée one of the meaneſt. The reſt like traitors refuſed. Secondly it is falſe, that ſhée was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by force of papiſts. For what néeded force, if all were willing ſhée ſhoulde bée crowned? and if the papiſts were
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:177777:29"/> vnwilling, it is not likely, they would vſe force, vnleſſe it was to force their owne wils.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly it is moſt falſe, that ſhée ſhewed herſelfe in all points of religion and behauiour both in her ſiſters daies, and at her coronation a papiſt. For if ſhée had ſo done, why ſhould the popiſh prelats feare any alteration, ſeeing ſhée gaue no ſigne of any, as this babling companion prateth? And why ſhould they refuſe to ſacre her, if ſhée ment to obſerue all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ceremonies, vnleſſe they doubted of her title? Laſtly it is moſt falſe, that ſhée was crowned at a maſſe. For ſhée decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red plainly, ſhee woulde no maſſe, which was a great occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, why the popiſh biſhops refuſed to conſecrate her.</p>
                     <p>But were this true, yet his coniecture of happineſſe, that would haue enſued of continuance of the maſſe, is moſt vaine and fooliſh. For albeit the French kinges <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the third continued the maſſe, and all popiſh ceremonies; yet neither did the kingdome of France flouriſh in their times, nor were their ſubiectes eyther vnited to their princes, or at vnity among themſelues. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they of the Low countries haue long continued in great troubles and diſſenſions, and béene forced to defend their liues and liberties againſt the violence both of the king of Spaine himſelfe, and of his agentes; albeit the king alwaies ſéemed a ſworne ſeruant and vaſſall of the pope of Rome, and a firme papiſt. The Portugals alſo neither greatly affect the Spaniſh king, nor do well ſort with the Caſtilians, or thoſe that fauor them, and haue now loſt their ancient glorie and libertie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit their princes haue ſtill continued vaſſals to the pope. Why then, notwithſtanding the continuance of popiſh religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, might not diſſenſion as well haue hapned in England be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the prince and people, and among the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? do we thinke, that our nation could ſtill haue endured the vnſatiable crueltie of popiſh prelates? or is it likely, that a frée people could haue endured the ſlauiſh yoke of the pope of Rome?</p>
                     <p>But bée it, that our countrey-men could haue ſwallowed all; yet muſt wée vnderſtand, that the pope of Rome woulde neuer haue ſuffred her Maieſtie to reigne, whom both <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the ſeuenth had declared illegitimate, &amp;<note n="a" place="margin">Sanders de ſchiſm.</note> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> the third pronounced vncapable of the crowne. This coniecture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:177777:30"/> of a flouriſhing kingdom, in caſe poperie had continued, is nothing, but a vaine flouriſh of a fooliſh diſcourſer. And ſo much the rather may we thinke ſo, becauſe no kingdome can floriſh without true religion: nor can they long agrée among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that haue no attonement with God, nor conſent in true faith.</p>
                     <p>Secondly he imagineth, that great ſecuritie woulde haue enſued of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of popiſh religion. For ſaith he, <hi>Then none of theſe feares and terrors of inuaſions, conqueſts, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and conſpiracies had euer come in conſideration.</hi> But hée much miſtaketh the knights meaning, if he do ſuppoſe, that hée either feareth the force of forreine enimies, or the ſecret practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of traitors. For hée feareth them not, but exhorteth his countrymen to prepare themſelues to repulſe the forreine eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that is ſo buſie, and to watch, that they bee not intrapped by ſecret practiſes of pretended friends. True it is, that the rinegued and Hiſpaniolized Engliſh do by all meanes ſéeke to draw forreine enimies into the countrey, and to practiſe miſchiefe at home; but hée is very blinde, that ſéeth not, that we are as well able to reſiſt ſuch attempts, as euer our ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors were, and he is a baſtardly and daſtardly Engliſhman, that feareth to encounter the Spaniard in ſo good a cauſe, or is afraid of the Spaniſh brags. In the meane while it is woorth the marking, that this Noddy doth ſignify that either by force, or practiſe the papiſts meane to haue their will. And yet ſome men there bée, that will not ſée their malice, and thinke it needleſſe to take any courſe to reſiſt, and encounter their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe poperie had héere continued, how coulde this Noddy haue giuen vs warrant, that we ſhoulde haue béene neither oppugned by enimies abroad, nor by traitors at home? was not <hi>Henrie</hi> the third of France excommunicated by the pope, oppugned by his ſubiects, &amp; murdred by a Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nican frier, notwithſtanding his zeale in poperie and all his ſeruice done to the pope? Did not the Spaniard inuade Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall, albeit the people were all of one religion? Nay he that caſteth away gods true ſeruice, can neither be ſecured abroad, nor at home. Nor may we thinke that the pope woulde haue liked her Maieſtie with any condition, vnleſſe ſhée woulde haue receiued her crowne from him: which is a matter moſt diſhonorable
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:177777:30"/> to imagine, and abominable to vtter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>P.</hi> 8.</note> Thirdly he telleth vs that if her Maieſtie had embraced poperie, <hi>Shee had been by all likelyhood maried, &amp; mother of many faire, and prince like children.</hi> As though if ſhée had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhée might not as well haue maried, continuing in true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as in any other religion: or as if none coulde haue faire and princely children, but women of their faction. He imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that difference of religion hath hindred her mariage, but if he were as well acquainted with matters of ſtate as he doth pretend, he might haue knowne, that diuers great princes of a diuers religion haue ſought her, yea that the great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narke, whom he ſo highly extolleth would gladly haue mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with her, and promiſed to procure a diſpenſation to that purpoſe. Neither was religion any hinderance to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the preſent French kings ſiſter. But ſuppoſe no papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall prince woulde haue maried with her; yet might ſhee haue matched with kings and princes of true catholike religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if ſo ſhée had thought conuenient. Againe, ſuppoſe ſhee had maried, was not Quéene <hi>Marie</hi> alſo maried? yet was ſhee not mother of many faire and princely children. And the thrée laſt French kings died al not onely without faire children, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo without iſſue. This is then a méere toie and vaine fancie, to talke of children before mariage, ſéeing God doth often denie this bleſſing to diuers maried folkes, and often taketh awaie children, that are otherwiſe likely to liue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly</hi> he ſuppoſeth, <hi>if her Maieſtie had bene pleaſed to haue vpholden the maſſe, and to continue popiſh religion, and married, that then the ſucceſſion of the crowne ſhould haue beene eſtabliſhed in her iſſue.</hi> But he ſhould haue remembred that God ſaith by his<note n="b" place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.</note> prophet, <hi>that he will honor them, that honour him, and deſpiſe them, that deſpiſe him.</hi> As for idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and maintainers of ſtrange religions, they ſhall not proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Beſide this, who knoweth not, that the fruite of the womb is the bleſſing of the Lord: and that god doth often diſpoſe of kingdomes according to his diuine will, and pleaſure? Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the pope that taketh on him to be Chriſtes vicegerent would haue had a great ſtroke in this matter, eſpecially if ſhée had acknowledged his vſurped authoritie. Neither is it likely he would haue allowed her, and her iſſue, whom diuers of his anceſters by their definitiue ſentences had both ſhamefullie
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:177777:31"/> diſhonoured, and iniuriouſly diſabled. And to bring ſo great a prince to ſubmit her ſelfe to ſo baſe a ſlaue, and of him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue her right to the crowne, were a matter diſhonorable to her Maieſtie and intollerable to the ſtate, and a frierlike fancy not to be imagined of any, but of <hi>Parſons</hi> the Ieſuite, and ſuch like trayterous rinegued fugitiues.</p>
                     <p>But let vs ſuppoſe, that her Maieſtie ſhould leaue no iſſue behind her, is ſhe the firſt, that hath béene in that caſe? and is there no remedy eyther by lawes already prouided, or by wiſe men to be deuiſed, but that we muſt needes fall by the eares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether about this matter? This is the ſuppoſition of the noddy our aduerſarie: and this garboyle percaſe he deſireth, to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and the Spaniard, whoſe ſlaue hée is: but our truſt is in God, and in the reſolution of honeſt men, that I hope, will prouide for the ſafetie of the ſtate, and looke to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the malice of thoſe, that are ſo deſirous of our trouble.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly hée telleth vs of the popes excommunication denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt her Maieſtie, and maketh a great matter of it. And ſaith, <hi>That if religion had not beene changed, we ſhoulde haue had no breach with Rome, nor needed to haue feared this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thunderbolt of excommunication.</hi> But what more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, then to obiect the breach with Rome, and the popes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, when we eſtéeme that to be one of the greateſt bleſſings that euer hapned to this lande, being thereby fréed from the ſlauerie of Antichriſt, and the darkneſſe of Egypt, and do no more feare the popes thunderbolt of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then a flaſh of light out of a lantern. Wee know what the pope is, and how little power he hath to excommunicate any Chriſtian, being himſelfe excommunicate, and vnwoorthy the name of a biſhop. But to let paſſe all this which the Nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die our aduerſarie paſſeth by, and ſhall neuer prooue; I ſay, that princes that continue in popiſh religion, haue notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding felt the ſharpeneſſe or bluntneſſe of the popes boltes, I would ſay buls, and continued long in the popes diſpleaſure. The ancient Germaine emperors <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth and fift, &amp; the two <hi>Fridericks</hi> &amp; diuers other that ſuccéeded them, knew no religion, but that which the pope taught, which no doubt was a goodly religion; &amp; yet hée thundred out his excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations againſt them, &amp; perſecuted diuers of them to the death, yea and after death. Betwixt <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>12.</hi> of France, which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:177777:31"/> for his bountie was called <hi>The father of his countrey, and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius the ſecond,</hi> there hapned a great breach, and out came ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications againſt him, and againſt his followers; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit about matters of religion there was no different betwixt them. No man was more ſuperſtitious in popiſh religion then <hi>Henrie</hi> the third of France; yet was he ſlaine by a Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, and excommunicated by the pope. The ſame may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the late excommunication of <hi>D. Caeſare da Eſte</hi> duke of Ferrara, and infinite examples. Suppoſe then the Quéenes Maiſtie coulde haue liked of the ſect of Antichriſt, and his abominable religion; yet woulde he haue diſliked and looked to haue had ſome finger in diſpoſing of the crowne: ſo that all theſe ſuppoſals reſt vpon weake groundes, which by no reaſon can well ſtand.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly hée ſaith, <hi>That if this breach with Rome had not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then England had continued in her old ancient amitie with Spaine and Burgundie.</hi> As if it were not more hurtfull to the Spaniard to breake with vs, then for vs to breake with the Spaniard. Surely if her Maieſtie woulde haue taken her aduantage either in the Low Countries, or in the Indies, and if the penſioners of Spaine had not béene more happie in breaking all enterpriſes againſt king <hi>Philip,</hi> then men of ſeruice incouraged to attempt them; hée ſhoulde well haue perceiued this to bée true long ere this. And therefore among diuers inſtructions, which the emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift left his ſonne, this was one principall; <hi>That by no meanes hee ſhould breake with England.</hi> But admit this were a matter dangerous, to fall out with Spaine, howe coulde wée haue auoided it by continuing in popiſh religion, ſéeing the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals, that are perfect papiſts coulde not by any mediation kéepe their countrey from his vſurpation and tyrannie? Naie pope <hi>Paulus</hi> the fourth claiming ſomewhat, that the Spaniard was vnwilling to yéeld, coulde by no terror of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hinder<note n="a" place="margin">Hiſtoria Adriani.</note> king <hi>Philips</hi> armie, but it entred vpon the popes countrey, and proſecuted his holineſſe with great rigour. So likewiſe in Iuliers and Italy the Spaniard hath iniam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vpon others right, notwithſtanding conſent in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                     <p>Further hée doubteth not to affirme, <hi>That the warres and tumults in kingdomes rounde about vs haue principally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:177777:32"/> from alteration of religion in England.</hi> Which is but a ridiculous conceite, and a vaine imagination. For when as yet England continued in popiſh ſuperſtition, the pope and his agents ſtirred vp <hi>Charles</hi> the fift to perſecute the princes of Germanie, &amp; <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt his officers to murder the poore inhabitants of Cabriers and Merindol. And when her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie came to the crowne, all the worlde knoweth, that her ſtudie was rather peace then warre, as her agents can yet te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, that often mooued both the Spaniard to ceaſe his warres in the Low Countries, and the French to deſiſt to perſecute his ſubiects, that except in matters of their conſcience promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed al obedience. Beſide that it is a fond imaginato<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thinke, that her Maieſtie or her agents had that credite in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that ſhée coulde make them take armes at her pleaſure. No, no, the worlde is witneſſe, that it is the pope, that is the firebrand of the warres throughout all Chriſtendome. Hée ſtirred vp <hi>Charles</hi> the fift againſt the Germaines, as appéereth both by his letters, and negotiation with him, and by the aide hée ſent to him againſt them. Hée enflamed the warres in France, and neuer woulde let matters ſettle, as appéereth by the negotiation of his legates, and by infinite teſtimonies. When as yet her Maieſtie did not ſo much, as procéed againſt any papiſt for religion; then did <hi>Pius</hi> the fift that furious frier publiſh his ſhameleſſe and railing bull againſt her, and ſent <hi>Nicholas Morton</hi> to perſwade the Earles of Weſtmerland and Northumberland, and their followers to rebell againſt her. And ſo hée declareth himſelfe to be Antichriſt, that ſhall cauſe all to bée ſlaine that will not admit his religion, and that is figured in the ſecond beaſt, Apocal. <hi>13.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This companion therefore that doth impute the cauſe of warres vnto vs, is like that good fellow, that ſaide the cauſe why hée robbed and ſpoiled, was becauſe men carried money with them vpon the high way. Wée cannot hinder the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and ambition of the pope and Spaniard, that proſecuteth warres againſt innocents. But they are to be blamed, that offer violence to the peaceable, and defende open wrong, and not they, that mainteine their right.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly hée telleth vs, and that in a lamentable voice, <hi>That if this alteration had not hapned, wee had not ſeene the depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of all the ſacred order of biſhops in one day togither
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:177777:32"/> with their perpetuall impriſonment, nor ſo many noble houſes ouerthrowne, nor ſo many troubled for perſiſting in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers faith, and not conſenting to this change, nor the tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, hanging, and quartering of a hundred prieſts, moſt of them gentlemen, and youthes of rare witte.</hi> Percaſe he is hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſhedde ſome few teares. Aſſuredly hée wéepeth without iuſt cauſe. For neither were all the popiſh prelates depriued in one day, nor were they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to perpetuall impriſonment. Nor was any papiſt héere directly troubled for perſiſting in his fathers faith, nor haue any noble houſes bin ouerthrowne by religion, but rather by rebellion. Neither were thoſe ſimple &amp; vnlearned youthes, whom the popes agents haue ſent into England, to prepare the way to rebellion, hanged and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered for religion, but for treaſon. Further we ſay for anſwer, that thoſe prelates whom he talketh of, were no biſhops nor teachers, but woluiſh murderers of Gods ſaints, and hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Antichriſt, whoſemarke they bore: and yet diuers of them were ſuffred to runne away. Some of them were neuer impriſoned; others were onely reſtrained, &amp; that either to their owne houſes, or to places, where they had all things in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. Nay albeit they refuſed to conſecrate her Maieſtie, and denied her right; yet ſhée did not, as ſhée might lawfully, vſe force againſt them. But if any ſhoulde denie to conſecrate the pope, albeit no prince, yet ſhoulde it coſt them their liues. Further the worlde knoweth, how much her Maieſtie hath fauoured her nobilitie. Shée coulde not doe more honour to any, then to the duke of Norfolke. Yet coulde ſhée not mollifie his hart toward her. She neuer thought euill of the earle of Weſtmerland and Northumberland; yet did they ſéeke her deſtruction at the ſolicitation of a wicked prieſt called <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Morton. Henrie</hi> Earle of Northumberland albeit farre engaged in practiſes of rebellion, yet was he ſuffred to enioy his honour and liuing. And diuers that were farre intereſſed in that action, were not called in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If then any periſhed in thoſe practiſes, the fault was wholy their owne. Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie was ſorrowfull for their wilfulneſſe, rather then cauſe of their ouerthrowe. As for wilfull Recuſants they were not once called in queſtion, before that the pope vſed their obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as a meanes to worke the ouerthrow of the ſtate. And now notwithſtanding they do adhere to the pope, her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:177777:33"/> enimie, and will not diſauow his authoritie in depriuing her of her right, which is a matter of great conſideration; yet all their puniſhment is onely a mulct for not comming to church; and reſtreint, that they doe not eaſily ioine with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine enemies. They enioy their landes, their goods, and moſt of them too great libertie, albeit euill affected to the ſtate, and wholy addicted to a moſt abominable and damnable religion. Our brethren in other places onely for profeſſing the truth without other cauſe, looſe not onely goods, landes, and country, but libertie and life alſo. Wherefore if they be wiſe, let them acknowledge, that they liue vnder a gratious Princeſſe; and ſee, that ſuch leud proctors as this, leaue prating in their cauſe, leaſt they heare that, which ſhall make them ſéeme vnworthy all fauour in all indifferent mens iudgment.</p>
                     <p>Againſt the poore yoong men, that haue died for their practiſing for the pope, I wil not ſay much. I do rather lament, that they ſhould be ſo abuſed, as to be drawne out of their countrey to forreine enemies, and to be emploied in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, either to their owne deſtruction, or to the hurt of their countrey: but moſt of all, that they ſhoulde, to the finall loſſe of their ſoules, yéeld themſelues thrall to Antichriſt, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his damnable doctrine, and hereſies. Onely thus much, being vrged by this Noddies importunitie, I could not chooſe but ſay in defence of our religion, and the preſent gouernment, that they were executed for treaſon and not for their hereſies, or falſe doctrine. Which appéereth notoriouſly by their endite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the euidence, by the iudgement and manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. That the ſentence is moſt iuſt, it is euident both by the ancient lawes of this lande, and by the lawes of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. By the<note n="a" place="margin">25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.2.</note> ſtatute of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, it is adiudged high treaſon, <hi>To imagine the death of the prince, or to ſtirre vp warre againſt her, or to be adhaerent to her enimies.</hi> But there is no one of theſe, but is adherent to the pope the publike eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of her Maieſtie and this ſtate: all receiue authoritie and inſtructions from him, and ſticke not to defend his authoritie. Moſt of them are his ſalaried ſchollers, or agents. Manie of them haue receiued ſtipends of the Spaniſh king, and ſome were emploied in his nauie <hi>anno 1588.</hi> and ſent againſt Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. All of them deſired warres to be raiſed againſt Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and ſome of them were agents to enduce the Spaniard
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:177777:33"/> to make warre vpon vs. That the pope is enimie to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie and this lande, I thinke no man will make queſtion, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſéeketh to depriue her of the crowne; raiſed the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the north, and in Ireland; and ſtirred vp the Spaniard to take armes againſt vs; and himſelfe armed ſhips and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to fight againſt vs, and ſought in plaine termes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the prince, and as they<note n="a" place="margin">In vita Pij <hi>5.</hi>

                        <hi>take on him a note of faction.</hi> The ſame lawes are alſo practiſed both in France and Spaine &amp; other countries. <hi>Alfonſo</hi> the <hi>9.</hi> king of Spaine, in his firſt booke <hi>Del fuero real, tit 2.</hi> by ſtrict lawes prouideth for the ſafetie of the prince. And moſt ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge it were, ſéeing lawes prouide for the ſecuritie of particulars, that the law ſhoulde not take holde of thoſe, that practiſe againſt the whole ſtate. If then theſe yoong men had béene of ſuch wit, and learning, and other good parts, as this fellow pretendeth; they woulde neuer haue ſuffred themſelues to be drawne into a faction againſt their prince and countrie; and others héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, if they be wiſe, wil take héed, how they abuſe the princes clemencie. In Ireland ſufferance and impunitie of ſuch fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes hath wrought euill effects. He that is not blinde may alſo ſée, what they entend in England: and, if he be wiſe, will not ſuffer ſuch vipers to gnaw their mothers bowels. So then it appéereth, that no great incommoditie, but rather great bleſſings haue hapned to this lande by the aboliſhing of pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and ſuperſtition.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe ſome temporall diſcommodities had enſued of this abolition of the maſſe, and of reſtoring of chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: yet moſt abſurd it were for temporall commodities to forſake our chriſtian profeſſion. <hi>He that taketh not vp his croſſe and followeth me,</hi> ſaith our ſauiour<note n="e" place="margin">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:177777:34"/> but our kindred and néereſt bloud is to be forſaken for Chriſtes ſake. <hi>He that loueth father or mother more then me, is not woorthy of me,</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> ſaith our ſauiour.<note n="b" place="margin">

                        <hi>Sidrac, Miſach</hi> and <hi>Abednago</hi> choſe rather to be throwne into the fierie furnace, then to worſhip an idoll. And ſhall we for any preſuppoſed feares forſake our God, and his truth, and fall downe before idoles, and yéelde our ſelues ſlaues to Antichriſt? a glorious thing it is to attaine wealth and honour in this world, and to be made generals and heads of ſocieties of friers and monkes, and to be made cardinals: but what ſhall it auaile a man, to winne the whole world, if he looſe his ſoule?</p>
                     <p>Whatſoeuer therefore may happen, let vs cleaue to the truth of Chriſt Ieſus, and hold on our profeſſion vnto the end. No man is crowned, but that ſtriueth vntill he haue obtained victorie. If wée looſe goods, landes, wife, children, father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or friend, God can reſtore them to vs againe. Nay if wée die in this quarrell, God can giue vnto vs a farre better life. Wherefore then ſhould we doubt, or feare?</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe, I ſay, the woorſt, yet haue we no cauſe to doubt. But if we will rightly conſider the preſent ſtate of things, we ſhall finde, that wée haue great cauſe to reioice, and hope the beſt. Our cauſe is iuſt and honeſt. For we ſtande for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, our prince, our countrey, our reputation, our wiues, our children, friends and whatſoeuer elſe is deere to vs. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had this countrey more men, nor better meanes either to defend, or offend. The cauſe is not ours alone, but of manie others. The enimie neuer was weaker, then at this inſtant. Onely this wanteth, that we deale boldly and reſolutely in ſo honeſt and godly a cauſe, and neither feare the vaine brags of forreine enimies, nor truſt the ſmooth gloſes of trecherous fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, popiſh prieſts, and rinegued Engliſh.</p>
                     <p>Now her Maieſtie is ſurely poſſeſſed of the crowne, and ſo well beloued of her ſubiects, as ſhée can deſire. Take away the practiſing prieſts, and malcontent traitors, and at home ſhée hath no cauſe of feare. In time paſt the popes of Rome had a ſtrong faction within the land, and diuided halfe of the regall authoritie with the prince. The clergie and people, for the moſt part, were his vaſſals. The countrey paide a great tribute to him. The treaſure of the lande was caried out at his pleaſure. Many ranne to him both for preferments, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:177777:34"/> iuſtice. now all this vſurped power is aboliſhed, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wholy dependeth next vnder God, on the prince: ſo that her authoritie and force now is farre greater, then in time paſt. Shée wanteth neither men, nor ſhips, nor ordinance, nor munitions of warre. If then her Maieſtie would be pleaſed to make an eſtabliſhment for the warres; and ſeriouſly to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how to reſiſt theſe, that now ſéeke her hurt, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of her people; we ſhoulde ſoone cauſe ſuch rinegued enimies of the countrey to change the note of their ſong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning dangers and feares; and force forreine enimies to thinke more, howe to defende themſelues, then to offende and offer violence to others. Such is the ſtate of our countrey, and ſuch are our meanes. Great cauſe therefore haue we, to giue God thanks, that hath beſtowed vpon vs ſo many ſpirituall and temporall graces. And if we do not vſe them to his glorie in exterminating the wicked reliques of Antichriſtianitie, and defending that truth, which we profeſſe; we ſhall ſhew our ſelues vnwoorthie of both, and hazard that which now we quietly poſſeſſe.</p>

                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth diſtinguiſh eccleſiaſtical gouernment, from ciuill gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereby it may appéere, that he woulde not haue the temporall magiſtrate to meddle with the church.

                     <p>Generally they all holde, that the prince is not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme abuſes in doctrine, but the councell of prieſts: which is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:177777:35"/> a poſition very abſurd. For firſt wée ſée, that vnder the law kings reformed abuſes, and eſtabliſhed orders in the church, as appeareth by the example of <hi>Hezekiah, Ioſia, Dauid,</hi> and others. Likewiſe among chriſtians <hi>Conſtantine, Valentinian, Gratianus, Theodoſius,</hi> and other princes did not onely reform abuſes, and condemne hereſies, but<note n="a" place="margin">Cod. de ſum.

Nay ſome there are that thinke it a matter vndecent, and vnneceſſary either to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand or to argue of matters of religion. <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, as <hi>Meteranus</hi> in his ſtory teſtifieth, commaunded, <hi>that no lay man ſhould diſpute of religion;</hi> and many were executed for that cauſe onely.

                     </p>
                     <p>They hold and teach further, that the pope determining matters of faith is to be beléeued, vnder paine of damnation, and this is that, which Sir <hi>Francis</hi> meant, and which both <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and all the popiſh crew writeth, and beléeueth. And yet we find, that he approoueth many damnable hereſies, as that of the Angelickes, Collyridians, Staurolatrians, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichées in miniſtring the communion vnder one kinde, the Pelagians in extolling the merits and force of works, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others. <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight holdeth, that none can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but ſuch as be ſubiect to the pope. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

                     <p>Laſtly they teach, that the pope hath power to pardon all ſinnes. And that is ſo true, that it cannot bée denied. For they giue him all Chriſtes power in earth.

Neither hath this Noddy any ſufficient ſkill to ſhift off the matter. Much be braggeth and faceth; but what ſhoulde wée reſpect wordes, when we ſée no truth in his meaning?</p>
                     <p>To acknowledge Gods fauour towards vs in deliuering vs both out of the ſpirituall thraldome of Antichriſt, and the temporall ſlauerie of ſtrangers, and accumulating vpon the people of this land, diuers other both ſpirituall and temporall bleſſings, hée eſtéemeth to bée but flatterie and faire gloſing: and to charge the papiſts with ignorance, and ſtrange opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hée counteth no better then <hi>cogging and lying,</hi> mixing a number of wordes borrowed partly of cheating companions, with whom it ſhould ſéeme hée hath much conuerſed, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of railing ſophiſters, among whom hée hath long trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed. But as I haue wiped away the accuſation of flatterie, ſo I doubt not, but I ſhall eaſily anſwer this cogging mates brabling about lying and cogging.</p>
                     <p>Hée taketh in great ſcorne, that it ſhoulde bée ſaide, <hi>That a darke and miſtie cloud of ignorance did couer the lande in Queene Maries time;</hi> and ſaith, <hi>That it was as wiſe and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as Italy or Spaine is at this day, where our teachers if they ſhoulde appeere, dare not open their mouthes in ſchooles, or matters of learning.</hi> And therefore at his pleaſure hee calleth them <hi>Sunſhine doctors, and inlightened, and ſunne borne mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi> Finally hée telleth vs, <hi>That in Queenes Maries time there was as learned a clergie, as in many ages before, and that our biſhops,</hi> which in contempt he calleth poore creatures, <hi>are no way comparable, to Tonſtall, Watſon, Chriſtopherſon, Fecnam, Gardiner, &amp; White that then liued.</hi> But wherein he thinketh moſt gloriouſly to triumph, there hée ſheweth moſt follie. For firſt admit theſe men, that hée nameth, were great doctors, yet it followeth not thereof, but that the people liued in great errour and blindneſſe: which is a matter ſo apparant, that it cannot bée denied. For few could ſay their <hi>Pater noſter</hi> and Beléefe, and of thoſe that coulde by hart ſay them, not one among twentie vnderſtoode them. Like parates they ſaid, <hi>Credo in Deum,</hi> but vnderſtoode not what they ſaide. They praied likewiſe, but vnderſtoode not, what they praied. Nowe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:177777:36"/> what auaileth it to pray with the lips, if the hart vnderſtande nothing? Likewiſe they came to church, and heard Mattins, Euenſong, and Maſſe in Latin. But what were Engliſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that vnderſtoode no Latine, the better? They were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe taught to praie not onely to angels, ſaints, and to our Ladie, but before ſtockes, and ſtones, little vnderſtanding the ſchoole diſtinction of <hi>Doulia,</hi> and <hi>Latria,</hi> without which they coulde hardly auoide the crime of idolatrie. The preachers as<note n="a" place="margin">

                        <hi>Dante</hi> ſaid <hi>Preached old wiues tales &amp; legends,</hi> &amp; ſcriptures were then not ſuffered to be read of the vulgar ſort. How then was it poſſible, that this people ſhould vnderſtand any thing? Secondly wée do very well know, what kinde of men theſe were which the aduerſarie nameth. Their writings are yet extant, and nothing ſingular. And when in the beginning of this Quéenes daies they were chalenged to diſpute, and felt their owne weakeneſſe, they vtterly refuſed. Procure vs the like libertie to diſpute in <hi>Seuill,</hi> or <hi>Paris,</hi> or <hi>Milan,</hi> and ſée whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we wil refuſe to diſpute with theſe great Rabbines. Now wée confeſſe indéed, we are not open our mouthes in ſchooles in Spaine, &amp; Italy. But the reaſon is, for that it is death to defend truth. But if we were no more afraid of their ſwords, then their arguments, they ſhoulde ſoone perceiue, that wée both durſt, and woulde open our mouthes againſt the prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of their Ieſuits, and woulde either ſhut their mouthes, or make it appéere, that they crie and ſpeake without reaſon. Wherefore let this lunaticall or extaticall frier either forbeare to bragge, or elſe procure vs libertie to diſpute: and then hée ſhall ſée, how hée is vnable to match thoſe, whom héere he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth with ſcorne, gibing at their lawfull wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when he and his conſorts, and all the rable of prieſts and friers walloweth in all filthineſſe and abominations, making no conſcience of whooredome, and publikely maintaining bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſſaes and concubines, and a race of baſtardes about them, and many of them dooing woorſe: all which ſhall be iuſtified by particulars, if our aduerſarie deſire triall in this point. Laſtly it is not the learning of fiue or ſixe, that can make all the reſt of the clergie ſéeme learned. It may bée, theſe fewe were tolerablie learned. But certes the ignorance of the other maſſe prieſtes was excéeding great. Now in Spaine and Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie not euery tenth man vnderſtandeth his Portuis or Miſſal,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:177777:37"/> and in matter of religion little or nothing. Wherefore if the paſtor be ſo ignorant and blinde, it is no maruell though the people be farre more blinde, rude and ignorant.</p>
                     <p>He telleth vs, <hi>That it is no haereſie, nor neuer was ſo accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to read on the Bible in any language whatſoeuer.</hi> And yéeldeth this reaſon, <hi>For that by licence of the ordinarie it is permitted to infinite lay people to read Scriptures in vulgar tongues.</hi> Secondly hée ſaith, <hi>That none was euer called for this fault onely before the Romiſh clergie, and branded to the ſlaughter.</hi> And becauſe ſir <hi>Francis Haſtings</hi> doth holde the contrarie, hée doth giue him the lie, and with very braue wordes make ſhew, as if hée woulde challenge him into the field, facing &amp; brauing like a falſe ſhameleſſe frier. But when it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the point, hée paſſeth ouer the matter with a fewe railing wordes, ſhewing himſelfe a cowardly challenger, that hauing giuen the lie, runneth out of the field without daring to abide other triall, then by the toong. In which alſo I doubt not, but to giue him the foile. For the firſt is very euidently diſproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by diuers examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in king <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, &amp; Quéene <hi>Maries daies;</hi> where it was obiected to lay men, that they read the Scriptures in Engliſh: which ſhould not haue béene done, vnleſſe by that article they ſhould haue béene conuinced of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. The ſecond is likewiſe diſprooued by diuers precedents and records, whereby it appéereth, that poore people were both called, and condemned for reading of the Scriptures. In the beginning of king <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight his reigne, certaine were condemned for reading the Epiſtles of ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> in Engliſh, as appéereth by the regiſters of Lincolne dioceſſe: and biſhop <hi>Longland</hi> preaching at their burning, ſaide <hi>That they were damned that mooued their lippes in reading thoſe chapters of Scripture,</hi> for which thoſe martyrs were condemned. Diuers were abiured for reading ſcriptures. One of them was bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a bible in Engliſh about his necke, to declare the cauſe of his burning. Both thoſe points are alſo prooued by the prouinciall conſtitution<note n="a" place="margin">Conſt. pro. c. praeterea. de haeretic.</note> of <hi>Thomas Arundell. Statuimus,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>vt nemo textum aliquem ſacrae Scripturae authoritate ſua in linguam Anglicanam, ſeualiam transferat, nec legatur aliquis huiuſmodi liber, &amp;c. vel publicè vel occultè ſub poena maio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris excommunicationis. qui verò contra hoc fecerit, vt fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor haereſis, &amp; erroris ſimiliter puniatur.</hi> So it appéereth, it
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:177777:37"/> was vnlawfull to read ſcriptures in vulgar toongs, and that ſuch readers were puniſhed as heretikes, or ſuſpect of hereſie: and that the challenger our aduerſary lieth notoriouſly in both theſe points. Further hée maketh a third lie, where he ſaith, that <hi>Infinite lay people are by the ordinarie permitted to read the Scriptures tranſlated into vulgar toongs.</hi> For in all Spaine I beléeue hée cannot name thrée that haue this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and very vnlike it is, they meane that the people ſhall read Scriptures tranſlated, when they will not tranſlate them themſelues, and forbid all other tranſlations, but their owne. Beſides this, who dare deſire leaue to read Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures tranſlated, when it is a note of hereſie with them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſuch a matter?</p>
                     <p>But leaſt we ſhoulde miſtake this cholericke gentlemans meaning, that is ſo readie to giue the lie, and the ſtab for euery worde, let vs heare him declare his meaning concerning rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of tranſlations of Scriptures in his owne termes. Firſt ſaith he, <hi>moſt certaine it is, that no man or woman was euer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to read any part of the holy ſcriptures in any of the three learned languages, wherein they were written, to wit, Hebrew, Greeke or Latin.</hi> Secondly hée declareth vnto vs, <hi>That the reſtreint of vulgar tranſlations was made onely to this end, that no tranſlations ſhoulde be vſed, except it were firſt examined by learned men, by order of the biſhop and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie:</hi> and then he ſaith, <hi>That ſuch lay men were permitted by the ordinary to vſe the ſaide tranſlation, as were thought fit and able to profite by it.</hi> And this hée beareth vs in hande to bée <hi>the ordinance of the catholike church.</hi> But firſt hée ſhoulde haue done well to haue ſhewed vs, what catholike church did ſo ordeine. For if hée meane the conuenticle of Trent, hée is an abſurd fellow to thinke that ſcum and ſinke of prieſtes and friers, which there gathered a councell againſt Chriſt and againſt his church, to betray the ſame to Antichriſt, to be the catholike church. Beſide that, their determinations were not onely contrarie to Chriſts doctrine, but to the authoritie and practiſe of the church, and namely in this, that they limited the reading of Scriptures in vulgar toongs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly it is moſt ridiculous to permit lay men or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to read the Bible in Hebrew, Gréeke or Latin, when ſo few of them among the papiſts vnderſtand thoſe toongs, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:177777:38"/> this permiſſion is nothing, but an excluding of vulgar tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and barring the people from reading ſcriptures.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly it is great ignorance to ſay, the ſcriptures were firſt written in Latin, and vnreaſonable to permit the Latin vulgar tranſlation more then others; and ridiculous, to call theſe thrée toonges learned, ſéeing in times paſt vnlearned men vnderſtood them, and now diuers learned do not well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them. Neither is it materiall, that ſome hold, that Saint <hi>Markes</hi> goſpell was written firſt in Latine. For their proofes are weake, and that is but one part of ſcripture. But here wée talke of reading all the ſcriptures.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly it is moſt plaine, while they allow no tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but ſuch as themſelues make, and either ſeldome make any, or making any do moſt ſhamefully corrupt the text, as the Rhemiſtes haue done in the tranſlation of the new teſtament, the Ieſuites in their tranſlation of the bible into French, and lately printed at Lyons; that they ſéeke either to exclude the people from reading ſcriptures, or elſe to giue them poiſon for Scripture. That is apparant, for that hitherto they haue not tranſlated the Bible into Italian, Spaniſh, or Dutch: nor greatly allow the French. This is moſt euident by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked peruerſion of the text, and that both by wrong tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and alſo by peruerſe annotations, as ſhal be ſhewed fully, if God ſend me life, and in the Rhemiſh Teſtament hath béene already ſhewed by doctor <hi>Fulke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To prooue that the order of the Romiſh church in prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting reading of vulgar tranſlations is good, hée alleageth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that foraſmuch as many tranſlations are falſe, it is fit to examine them, <hi>Leaſt for Gods word the ſimple might embrace mans worde.</hi> Againe hée ſaith, <hi>That albeit the tranſlation bee true, yet vnleſſe the reader can gather out of it a true ſenſe, it is not fit hee ſhoulde be permitted to read that tranſlation of Scripture.</hi> And this hée beléeueth to bée meant by ſaint<note n="a" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>That the letter killeth, and the ſpirite quickneth.</hi> But if tranſlations bée falſe, why are not ſome true tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons publiſhed, that the vulgar ſort may haue benefit by them? Againe, if onely tranſlations for their falſhood bée condemned, why doth the wicked ſynagogue of Rome<note n="b" place="margin">In indice. libror. prohib.</note> condemne moſt true tranſlations? Do they not ſhew, that they hate the light of the Scriptures? Thirdly if none may read vulgar tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:177777:38"/> but ſuch as are able to drawe true ſenſe out of them; why are all ſuffred to read the Latin being not able to drawe true ſence out of it? This aſſuredly is a courſe to debarre all men from reading of Scriptures, and the Romiſh ſynagogue eſpecially, for that the ſame draweth moſt peruerſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations out of Scripture, and vnder the name of wholeſome Scriptures giueth to the people moſt poiſoned doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to Scriptures. Beſides it is a courſe contrarie to the exhortation of our Sauiour, that ſpeaking to the people ſaide; <hi>Scrutamini Scripturas;</hi> and contrarie to antiquitie, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the people to read the Scriptures. Finally hée doth ſhamefully abuſe the wordes of S. <hi>Paul. 2. Cor. 3.</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of reading of Scriptures. <hi>For if becauſe the letter killeth,</hi> the lay people are not to read the ſcriptures; then none is to read them, ſeeing reading and not vnderſtanding killeth: which is moſt abſurd. Secondly if the apoſtle did meane the outward letter without ſence, yet woulde it make nothing againſt reading of Scriptures. For if the bare letter without the ſenſe killeth, then ought euery man to read diligently, that he may vnderſtand the ſenſe. Thirdly this interpretation condemneth the practiſe of the papiſts in reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in an vnknowne toong in the church. For if the letter kill without the meaning, then do the papiſts kill Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that read Scriptures in Latin to the people, which vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand nothing of the ſenſe. Fourthly the apoſtle cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably by the letter that killeth vnderſtand the ſcriptures, for then ſhoulde they bée verie vnprofitable, contrarie to the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the apoſtle that ſaith,<note n="a" place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</note> 
                        <hi>The Scripture is profitable to teach, to improoue, to correct and inſtruct in righteouſneſſe.</hi> Laſtly<note n="b" place="margin">Li. <hi>1.</hi> de verb. dei. c. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his companion may inſtruct him, that none but the Zuencfeldians, &amp; Drigeniſtes, by the letter that killeth, vnderſtand Scriptures, as this Noddie doth, ſhewing himſelfe therein a plaine heretike, and enimie to Scriptures. The true meaning therefore of <hi>Paules</hi> wordes is, that the outward preaching of the worde, being deſtitute of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite working internally, doth kill: to the profite or diſprofite of reading Scriptures, they make nothing.</p>
                     <p>He telleth vs further, <hi>That the vnderſtanding of Scriptures is a particular gift of God reſerued to Chriſt eſpecially, and by him beſtowed on the church:</hi> which he prooueth by this place;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:177777:39"/> 
                        <hi>Tunc aperuit illis ſenſum, vt intelligerent Scripturas:</hi> and by the example of the Eunuch, <hi>That without Philip the apoſtles helpe could not vnderſtand the prophecie of Iſaie.</hi> Beſide all this, hée telleth vs, <hi>That dim ſighted people cannot diſcerne things without a guide.</hi> All which reaſons do ſhewe, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his faire ſhewes, hée hath but a dimme ſight in diuine matters, and is but a blinde guide, that woulde drawe Gods people from reading of Scriptures, and percaſe leade them to the reading of lying legends, and ſuch like fantaſticall writings of the Romiſh ſynagogue. Againſt the reading of holy Scriptures his fond reaſons conclude nothing. For if Chriſt bée the beſt interpreter, where ſhoulde wée better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what his interpretations are, then in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? And if hée haue beſtowed the gift of interpreting ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on the church, how ſhoulde the people be better aſſured of the excellencie of the churches interpretation, then by ſéeing the ſame confirmed by ſcriptures? For which cauſe the Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans red the Scriptures, and are therefore commended.</p>
                     <p>Secondly if the men that went to<note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>Luc.</hi> 24.</note> Emaus, and the Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian<note n="b" place="margin">
                           <hi>Act.</hi> 8.</note> red the Scriptures, albeit they vnderſtood them not at the firſt: why ſhoulde Chriſtians bée barred from reading ſuch ſcriptures, as they vnderſtand? What more ſimple ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument can be deuiſed, then this; becauſe an interpreter is neceſſarie, that we may not read what hée interpreteth in a toong which we vnderſtand?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly <hi>Philip</hi> that taught the eunuch was not the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Philip,</hi> as the Noddy our aduerſary ſuppoſeth, ſhewing by example of himſelfe, that ſcriptures are not much to be red; but <hi>Philip</hi> the deacon. Laſtly it is a matter moſt ridiculous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome places are hard to be vnderſtood, to debarre the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the whole body of ſcriptures, eſpecially ſéeing many thinges are plaine and eaſie. Nay this reaſon may better be retorted vpon our aduerſary; becauſe diuers places are hard to be vnderſtood, that wée ſhould diligently read them, and heare them expounded, that we may both by theſe, and other places reape profit. And thus it may appéere, that euen ſimple wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whome this ſcoffing mate calleth proud proteſtant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſcorneth at them for reading holy ſcriptures, would be much aſhamed, if they could not reaſon better of theſe matters, then this great popiſh Rabbin, that taketh on him ſo boldly to

                     <p>Hauing thus fondly reaſoned of reading of ſcriptures he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth forſooth very wiſely, <hi>that falſehood &amp; hereſie is engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of reading of ſcriptures.</hi> And goeth about to prooue it firſt, by the example of <hi>William Hacket, William Ieffrey</hi> and <hi>Ioan Burcher;</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by experience, for that as he beléeueth, <hi>more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies are ſprung vp within theſe</hi> 50. <hi>or</hi> 60. <hi>yeeres ſince ſcriptures began to be red in vulgar toongs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in many ages before.</hi> But his concluſion is nothing, but a wicked calumniation of gods holy ſcriptures: and his proofes conſiſte of a packe of lies, &amp; both declare him to be a ſclanderous lying enymy of Gods truth. For it is not reading of ſcriptures, which he ſtileth <hi>raſh rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> béeing vſed by lay people, but neglect of ſcriptures, that bringeth foorth error and hereſie. Philoſophers therefore that contemned ſcriptures were called patriarkes of heretikes; and heretikes by<note n="a" place="margin">De reſur. carn.</note> 
                        <hi>Tertullian</hi> are called <hi>Lucifugae ſcripturarum,</hi> for that they fly from the light of ſcriptures. And that is proued euen by the examples produced by the aduerſary. For thoſe blaſphemous heretikes did not fall into their impieties and hereſies by reading ſcriptures, but by gyuing héede to fond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations, and renouncing ſcriptures. experience alſo teacheth the ſame. for while the light of Gods word was couered, and ſcriptures neglected, and héede giuen to popiſh decretalles, and Mahomets reuelations; all the hereſies of papiſts and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Mahomet, and many other errors, haue béene receiued by people ignorant of ſcriptures.</p>
                     <p>And that reading of ſcriptures is not cauſe of hereſies, it appeareth <hi>firſt,</hi> for that not ſimple people reading ſcriptures, but great clerkes reading philoſophie, and popiſh Decretalles, and ſchoole Doctors, haue béene authors of hereſies. <hi>Secondly</hi> in the Apoſtles times, when all might reade ſcriptures, then feweſt hereſies ſprung vp.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Ioan Burcher</hi> conueied bibles into the court, or had any acquaintance with <hi>Anne Askeugh,</hi> which this fellow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, is a lie deuiſed by himſelfe. Let him ſhew his author, if he can. that which he talketh of <hi>Anne Askeugh</hi> is impertinent. But ſuch is his blindeneſſe, hée will needes haue all the world ſée the cruelty of papiſts, that burnt that innocent woman for denying their tranſubſtantiation, which, if hée were wiſe, he would haue either denyed, or diſſembled, albeit ſome other
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:177777:40"/> ſhould haue ſpoken of it. And ſo it appeareth, that Sir <hi>Francis Haſtings</hi> had reaſon to charge the papiſts with hiding the ſcriptures from the peoples eyes, and kéeping them as it were couered in toonges vnknowne, contrary to Chriſts doctrine, &amp; precedentes of antiquitie. And no leſſe reaſon haue chriſtians to deteſt the boldneſſe of this frapling frier, that calleth prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, reading, and reaſoning of ſcriptures, <hi>clouting of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> And thus much may ſerue to ſhew, that the papiſts deale iniuriouſly, in taking away tranſlations of ſcriptures out of the hands of the multitude.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo moſt apparent, that they rather perſwade igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as fit for their blind deuotion, then knowledge: neither is this Rabbin able to ſhew the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. He alledgeth <hi>Thomas</hi> of Aquine for his warrant; and ſaith, that <hi>he diſputing of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, maketh ignorance neither to be mother, nor daughter, nor ſiſter of deuotion.</hi> But what if <hi>Thomas</hi> of Aquine doth not ſo teach, doth it therefore follow, that no other teacheth igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to be mother of deuotion? who would reaſon ſo ſimply and ignorantly, but he? beſide this, albeit his maſter <hi>Thomas</hi> doth not directly teach it, yet in effect he teacheth as much. For firſt he ſheweth,<note n="a" place="margin">2.2. <hi>q.</hi> 82. <hi>art.</hi> 3.</note> 
                        <hi>that deuotion doth moſt abound in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people, and in women.</hi> And ſecondly he<note n="b" place="margin">2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 2. <hi>aut.</hi> 6.</note> teacheth, <hi>that it is inough for the ſimpler ſort, to haue fidem implicitam,</hi> and to beléeue as the church, or as their ſuperiors beléeue, which is a meanes to bring in ignorance. Finally I haue ſhewed, that diuers others haue gone further in commending igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                     <p>He ſaith further, <hi>that all hold what Thomas holdeth,</hi> and ſo beginneth to make a long ſpeake of the nature, cauſe, and effectes of deuotion. But firſt albeit we graunted, that all held that, which <hi>Thomas</hi> holdeth, yet it doth not hereof follow, that the papiſts hold no more, nor otherwiſe then he holdeth. For then what néeded ſo many later bookes? and therefore this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is not to purpoſe. Beſide that, it is falſe. For the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes in moſt points diſſent from him, and in many points of ſchoole Diuinitie later doctors do contradict him, as namely in his opinions of the procéeding of the holy Ghoſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally from the father, of the conception in originall ſinne of the virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> of the tormenting of ſoules in purgatorie by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, of Chriſts locall being in the ſacrament, and infinite
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:177777:40"/> other matters.</p>
                     <p>Hée alleageth alſo a ſaying of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> concerning deuotion, and <hi>To make the wilfull malice of theſe good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes appeere,</hi> ſaith hée, <hi>Thomas of Aquine maketh this obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himſelfe.</hi> As if either <hi>Thomas of Aquines</hi> obiections to himſelfe, or elſe ſaint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> wordes could aſcertaine vs, what theſe fellowes hold, or hold not, ſéeing they diſſent from Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in many things, and in all things doe not iumpe with <hi>Thomas;</hi> and haue infinite nouelties more then either of theſe. Wherefore vnleſſe this fellow can ſhew, that doctors <hi>Cole</hi> neuer vttered any ſuch ſaying, and that the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of papiſts is not, to nouzell their people in blindeneſſe and ignorance; hée doth but trifle, and ſheweth himſelfe fitter to ſit in the alehouſe among the goodfellowes he ſpeaketh of, then to diſpute in ſchooles.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly hée braggeth much of the learning of papiſts, and telleth what monuments of learning they haue left behinde them, and what vniuerſities they haue built. All which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing to the purpoſe. For albeit there bée many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men among them, yet their common people may be very vnlearned and ignorant notwithſtanding: which is that, whereabout we contend. Againe if their learning be ſo great, the greater ſhall bée their condemnation, which in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Ieſus are ſo ignorant themſelues, and ſuffer alſo the people to liue in ignorance. Laſtly albeit we will not deny them to be learned, yet we doubt not, but to match them with men of our profeſſion; and if we compare them with the ancient fathers, they will be ouermatched. But whatſoeuer their learning is, good it were for them, if they would vſe it not to their owne, but to Gods glory.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe they teach, <hi>That lay men may not meddle with matters of religion:</hi> that is, that Princes haue no power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the church, nor to make eccleſiaſticall lawes. And our aduerſary confeſſeth, <hi>That onely prieſts haue authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine and determine matters of religion.</hi> What reaſon then hath hée to quarrell with ſir <hi>Francis Haſtings,</hi> ſéeing in effect he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth as much, as hée laieth to his charge? Forſooth ſaith he, <hi>Becauſe theſe words; To meddle with matters of religion, may haue a double ſence.</hi> But what if they might receiue a treble ſence, if the papiſts doe ſo remooue lay men from gouerment in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:177777:41"/> eccleſiaſticall cauſes, that they néede not to care how God is ſerued, then are they not wronged by him. For hée doth not meane care in their owne behalfe, but in reſpect of others. And therefore his example of miniſters wiues is very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. Neither hath hee reaſon to condemne lawfull mariage, when he and his conſorts wallow in all filthineſſe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, I ſay, the apoſtles doctrine, which alloweth a biſhop <hi>To be the husband of one wife,</hi> when hée teacheth the doctrine of diuels, that forbiddeth to marrie. Finally <hi>Parſons</hi> the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite hath no reaſon to condemne prieſts wiues, when his true father (as they ſay) was a parſon of a pariſh. his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo had béene more honeſt, if ſhee had béene maried to the parſon his father. Theſe ieſtes therefore, if hée looke no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his buſineſſe, may prooue him to bée irregular, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of prieſthood. But what is that, may hée ſay, when a baſtard maketh as good a Ieſuite, as hée, that is well borne?</p>
                     <p>Where wée ſay, that the papiſts ſtande more on externall complements, and ceremonies, then inwarde faith and other vertues, onely requiring an outward profeſſion, and outward obſeruations of going to maſſe, to ſhrift, and ſuch like; hee is much diſpleaſed with the matter, and ſaith, <hi>That his aduerſary hath neither eies nor witte.</hi> And yet this is the doctrine of the Romiſh church. <hi>Vt aliquis abſolutè dici poſſit pars verae eccleſiae,</hi> ſaith<note n="a" place="margin">Lib. de eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia. c. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Bellar. non putamus requiri vllam internam vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutem, ſed tantùm externam profeſſionem fidei, &amp; ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum communionem, quae ſenſu ipſo percipitur.</hi> And albeit he ſhoulde not ſo ſay, yet it is apparent, that thoſe are accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted good Cacolickes, that liue in obedience to the pope and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue his lawes, whatſoeuer they are otherwiſe. Nay of late time they haue canonized murtherers, traitors, and rebels, as for example, <hi>Iames Clement</hi> that murthred <hi>Henry</hi> the thirde of France, diuers of the rebels that roſe with the Earles of Northumberland and Weſtmerland in the north, and ſuch trecherous prieſts, as came from the pope to betraie their countrey to ſtrangers. In times paſt alſo <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> was canonized for a ſaint, albeit he was a traitor to his prince and countrey, ſtirring vp forreine enimies againſt them, moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the pope to depriue his prince of his crowne, running to profeſſed enimies, and conſulting with them to the hurt of his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:177777:41"/> prince, cauſing the land to be enterdited, and giuen as a ſpoile to forreine enimies; which neither <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> nor the holie fathers <hi>Athanaſius, Ambroſe, Hilary</hi> or <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> either did, or allowed to bée done. And therefore as theſe examples fit not <hi>Thomas Beckets</hi> cauſe, ſo <hi>Thomas Beckets</hi> example doth fitly ſhewe, how looſe men, and diſobedient ſubiects, are enterteined by the pope, and made ſaints in heauen, albeit they deſerue not to liue on earth. <hi>Lipomanus</hi> and <hi>Surius</hi> and others, I know, tell many goodly tales of this ſaint, but wée muſt remember, that all the grounde they haue is their lying Legend, and percaſe the popes ſentence grounded vpon heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaie.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Francis</hi> ſaith further, that <hi>Albeit the pope and his cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie commanded blaſphemies and diſloialties, yet blind papiſts were made beleeue, that the pope muſt be obeied vpon paine of damnation:</hi> And his meaning is moſt true. For although popes command matters impious againſt God, and diſloiall againſt princes; yet their friers and flatterers do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend them for glorious merits woorthie of celeſtiall glorie. <hi>Iames Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the Dominican frier that murdred king <hi>Henry</hi> the third of France, is eſtéemed a martyr of the popiſh ſynagogue. Pope<note n="a" place="margin">The oration of Sixtus quint. &amp; la fulmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante.</note> 
                        <hi>Sixtus quintus</hi> in the conſiſtory of Cardinals commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this deteſtable act, as <hi>A worke of God,</hi> a <hi>miracle,</hi> a <hi>rare exploit of Gods prouidence,</hi> and compareth it, to <hi>The moſt excellent myſteries of Chriſt his incarnation, and reſurrection.</hi> Cardinall <hi>Como</hi> in his letter to <hi>Parry,</hi> that went about to murder her Maieſtie, calleth the worke <hi>Meritorious. Sanders</hi> doth greatly commend the rebels of the north that vpon the popes commandement went about to depriue their liege So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereigne of her crowne, and kingdome. And what hath either <hi>Parſons</hi> the Ieſuite, or this perſonate Noddy (be hée what hée will) to obiect againſt vs in this point? Hée ſaith it is a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſlander, to ſay <hi>The pope commandeth either blaſphemies againſt God, or diſloialties againſt princes.</hi> And for the reſt hée telleth vs, <hi>That obedience to the pope is a commendation to catolike religion.</hi> But the firſt is prooued by his decretales, legends, miſſals, portuiſſes, and other rituall bookes full of blaſphemies. The ſecond is manifeſt by their practiſe. There hath no ſuch treaſon almoſt béene wrought againſt princes of late time, but the ſame hath procéeded from the pope, and béen
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:177777:42"/> managed by Ieſuits, and other friers and prieſts. All the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions in England againſt <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, &amp; <hi>Elizabeth</hi> now reigning, had no other cauſe, nor origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. The late league, or rather late rebellion of France againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, was made by the pope, and enflamed by the vermine of friers his agents. The Ieſuites profeſſe obedience to the pope, as to Chriſt. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> the eight maketh ſubiection to the pope to be a matter of ſaluation.<note n="a" place="margin">De eccleſ. milit. c. <hi>2.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh it an eſſentiall part of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colike, or true member of the popes church. And ſuch truſt haue papiſts in his iudgements concerning matters of faith, that they thinke hée cannot be deceiued. Nay if hée once ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther command, or determine any thing, they accompt it no better then ſacrilege to diſpute of his dooing: and<note n="b" place="margin">C. ſi papa. dist. <hi>40.</hi>
                        </note> holde, that if hée ſhoulde leade multitudes of ſoules to hell, yet no man muſt ſay to him, <hi>Domine cur ita facis?</hi> that is, <hi>Sir, why do you ſo?</hi> So generally the papiſts doe beléeue the pope, and obey his commandements. Which obedience and beléefe no man commendeth, but thoſe, that embrace all his hereſies, and are readie to execute his treaſons. For although wée are to obey our ſuperiors, and that not for feare, but for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake, and ought to harken to our paſtors: yet this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the pope, that is not our ſuperior, nor a true paſtour, but a woolfe, a hireling, and antichriſt, or as ſome terme him, The head of antichriſtes kingdome. Beſide that, wée are not to beléeue euery thing that our paſtors teach; but as<note n="c" place="margin">
                           <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.</note> farre, as they teach the doctrine of Chriſt Ieſus. Nor are wée abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to obey, but when they command according to lawe. O thriſe vnhappie they, that take theſe woolues for true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and beléeue their hereſies and treaſons to be true faith, and obedience!</p>
                     <p>Finally it is moſt true, that the papiſts, when they haue committed moſt abominable offences, and liued in all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, are notwithſtanding taught, that the pope hath power to pardon them, and abſolue them. <hi>Bellarmine</hi>

                        </note> faith, <hi>That indulgences are profitable for all manner of perſons:</hi> and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he extolleth the Iubiley, and generall indulgences granted by the pope. And for this cauſe many ſillie ſoules with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, charge, and danger trauell to Rome, and all with great hope to haue their ſinnes pardoned. This therefore is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:177777:42"/> no calumniation, nor forgerie, nor iugling tricke, as this ing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling companion telleth vs, who himſelfe hath many yéeres wandred vp and downe in forreine lands, like the Egyptians, or Cingari, and hath in his time plaied many tricks of legier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demayne, &amp; thinketh by his hopping, ſkipping, &amp; other apiſh trickes, that he can make fleſh and blood of a péece of bread, and therefore imagineth others to bée like himſelfe. But ſaith hée, <hi>The indulgence is not auaileable to remooue mortall ſinnes, but onely to take away the puniſhment either in this life, or in the life to come.</hi> And ſo the ſchoolemen commonly diſpute. But what is that to the purpoſe, when the common people beléeueth otherwiſe, and when in the indulgences they vſe not ſo to diſtinguiſh? Nay in the taxe of the popes indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences it appéereth, that for money they diſpenſe with all ſin. For money they pardon <hi>Murder of children, of men, of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of wiues, of neere kinred, fornication, adulterie, inceſt, and all vnnaturall abominations.</hi> As for all irregularities they make ſmall difficultie. Nay they giue licence for Iewes to builde ſynagogues, where Chriſt is blaſphemed, and pardon thoſe that fall into Iudaiſme and Turciſme. <hi>Pro licentia eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendi de nouo publicam ſynagogam,</hi> ſay<note n="a" place="margin">Taxa poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</note> they <hi>taxa eſt Turon.</hi> 60. <hi>ducat.</hi> 15.

So thoſe, that will not ſuffer Chriſtians to liue and to breath, giue priuileges and pardons to Iewes, and diſpenſe with apoſtataes, maranoes, and rinegued Turkes. Neither do they diſtinguiſh ſo ſubtilly, as our wiſe aduerſarie woulde haue them. Nor doe the papiſts reſpect more, then that they may haue plenarie indulgence vnder ſeale. But ſuppoſe that the pope ſhoulde onely take on him to remit the temporall puniſhment of mortall ſinnes, and to forgiue veniall ſinnes; yet that is contrarie to Chriſtes doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, to the apoſtles practiſe, to the ancient orders of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Rome, and of the catholike church, and maketh car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men more licentious in ſinning, when the penaltie is ſo eaſily redéemed; and ſpoileth many poore Chriſtians, that giue al, rather then they will endure the ſuppoſed extreme tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of purgatorie. O miſerable and ſimple papiſts, that ſuffer your ſelues to be ſo deluded, &amp; take paines, trauaile far, and powre out your money, and all to get nothing, but vaine
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:177777:43"/> wordes, and bare lead and paper, without any profite.</p>
                     <p>He telleth vs further, <hi>That the popes pardons differ from abſolution of prieſts by the keyes.</hi> And therein taketh ſome paines to relate the ſchoolemens opinion: as if it were materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, what ſuch doting diuines, and iangling friers do babble without all ground of ſcripture, or allowance of fathers. This is certaine, that both the pope himſelfe, and all other prieſts do challenge their authority by one commiſſion, and by vertue of the keyes. How then commeth it to paſſe, that the popes power and authority is ſo ample and large, and other inferior prieſtes ſo ſtraite and reſtreintife, both béeing ioyned in one patent? héere the Noddy will be intricated, if he ſhape not a better anſwere, then any is héere declared.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F this aduerſarie of ours had either bin a good Orator or a wiſe proctor; he woulde haue taken great heed, how he had touched any matter, that béeing opened might haue hurt his Clientes cauſe; eſpecially where his aduerſarie doth not greatly vrge him. But what ſhould we looke for better handling of ſo foule a cauſe? ſir <hi>Francis Haſtings</hi> ayming at other matters, doth but lightly touch the continued malice of the popiſh facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt her Maieſtie, euer ſince her firſt comming to the crowne, and that rather to warne the careleſſe ſubiect to take héede of ſuch an enimie, and to point at ſuch pernicious tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; then to hurt ſuch, as haue béene, and yet are abuſed by the craft and practiſe of others, and are not themſelues actors, nor factious, nor malicious to their countrey. To hurt quiet men, albeit abuſed by falſe colour of old religion, it was no part of his purpoſe. But ſéeing this ſimple Noddie hath no more reaſon, but to bare and touch that wounde, which bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſéene and touched muſt néedes gréeue many, and ſhame all the faction of papiſts, that haue ſhame to heare their owne, and their conſorts moſt abominable practiſes diſcouered; I am content to méete him in this encounter, and examine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bée true or no, that is commonly reported concerning the practiſes of papiſts againſt her Maieſtie, and this ſtate. If any miſlike this courſe, let him deale with the Noddie that drew mée into it. For mine owne part I was vnwilling to quarrell with them, but ſéeing they will néedes ſtande vpon termes, and challenge others; I coulde not chooſe but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</p>
                     <p>Neuer any thing in this Realme did more diſpleaſe the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:177777:44"/> papiſtes, then the match betwixt king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, and her Maieſties mother the Lady <hi>Anne Bollenne.</hi> for thereby not onely the popes authority to diſpence in cauſes of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but alſo to iudge in cauſes of princes was called in queſtion. Further they beganne to feare, leaſt the king, that was a prince of heroicall courage, would haue taken occaſion vpon this abuſe offered him, to haue looked into the whole cauſe of religion. Here began the hatred againſt her Maieſtie, which this faction hath borne her euer ſince, and which by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny attempts againſt her parents, and her ſelfe they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeuenth albeit he had receiued many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours from king <hi>Henry,</hi> and had promiſed otherwiſe; yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wonne by perſwaſions of <hi>Charles</hi> the fift then béeing em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, or elſe mooued with the intereſt, that himſelfe had in it, declared the kinges mariage to be voide, and the iſſue of that mariage vnlawfull. The which ſentence was giuen Anno <hi>1533.</hi> ſome little tyme before ſhe came into the world. So that it is no maruell, if now they hate her, which not onely in her parents, but alſo in her lawful right was perſecuted before ſhe came into the world.</p>
                     <p>Not long after <hi>Paul</hi> the third did furiouſly thunder out a ſentence of excommunication againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him of his kingdome, and againe declaring the mariage with the Lady <hi>Anne Bollen</hi> to be void, and her children to be illegitimate. With that fury did he proſecute that innocent la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and her children, ſparing nothing, which might ſerue to worke both their deſtructions. And when he could do nothing of himſelfe, he neuer ceaſed by Wincheſter, and other his agents to purſue the cauſe, vntill ſuch time, as they had cauſed an act of Parliament to bée made againſt both the mother and the daughter, and brought the innocent Ladie her mother to her end; and, which is more gréeuous, they loaded her with many ſlanders, and reproches, not onely in her triall, but alſo in an act of parliament. How vniuſtly God beſt knoweth, and the king himſelfe acknowledged with great griefe at his death, as<note n="a" place="margin">Coſmograph. lib. <hi>16.</hi>

                        <hi>Theuet</hi> a writer no way partiall hath teſtified. <hi>Pluſieurs gentilſ-hommes anglois,</hi> ſaith hée, ſpeaking of king <hi>Henry</hi> the eightes death, <hi>m'ont aſſeurè, qu'il eut belle repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance des offenſes par luy commiſes, eſtant a l'article de la mort: et entre lez autres choſes, de l'iniure et crime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:177777:44"/> contre la dicte roine Anne de Boulan, faulſement vaincue, et accuſee de ce qu'on luy impoſoit.</hi> It ſuffiſed not the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, to take away an innocent ladies life, but they tooke away alſo her honour and good name by diuers imputations, which God the moſt iuſt iudge knoweth, and, I truſt, one day will more plainly declare. Afterward it pleaſed God to put in the kings minde to reuerſe the act that debarred her Maieſtie of her right, which hée did by his laſt will. This ſo néerely tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the papiſts, that, as it ſhoulde ſéeme, they haue aboliſhed it, thereby endeuoring to take away all monuments and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, whereby her right might bée prooued. This rancor of theirs did eſpecially ſhew it ſelfe againſt her during the raigne of Quéene <hi>Mary.</hi> For although her beautie, vertue, good car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and many excellent parts, wherewith God had endued her, might haue mooued any to loue her; yet in theſe men theſe excellencies, and eſpecially her religion wrought contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. For doubting leaſt Quéene <hi>Mary</hi> hauing no iſſue ſhould leaue the kingdome to her, and fearing that ſhée woulde aſſwage their pride and tyrannie againſt Gods ſaints, and aboliſh their ſuperſtitious abuſes, and hereticall doctrine; they ſought by all meanes to cut her off from the crowne. The pope hée coulde not ſuffer his ſentences and decretals to bée reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; his adherents coulde endure no reformation of religion to bée eſtabliſhed. <hi>Gardiner</hi> charged her as an abbettor to <hi>Wyat,</hi> and ſaid ſhée had intelligence with him. And this our aduerſarie doth alſo ſignifie by his <hi>Myſticall bracelet,</hi> and other darke ſurmiſes. As if it were likely, that a poore yoong maiden deſtitute of friends and meanes, and in the handes of her enimies, could helpe them any thing: or that <hi>Wyat</hi> would communicate a counſell of ſuch danger to her, that percaſe might vtter it, and no way coulde helpe him. Howſoeuer it was, he practiſed with diuers to accuſe the innocent Lady, and percaſe, if God had not holpen her, had effected his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>That ſhe held Quéene <hi>Mary</hi> and the ſtate in ſuſpence and care, our aduerſary denyeth not. What then more probable, then that they ſhould ſéeke to diſburthen themſelues of that care and iealouſie? There are diuers that teſtifie, that they had diuers conſultations againſt her. Doctor <hi>Storie</hi> ſhewed plainly, <hi>That the papiſts committed a great error, in that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:177777:45"/> cutting of the boughs, they had not ſtrooken at the roote.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When either for ſhame, or elſe becauſe they could finde no probable cauſe againſt her, they could not ſpill the innocent Ladies bloud, it is certaine, that they fayned Quéene <hi>Mary</hi> to be with childe, to the intent that ſome ſuppoſed childe might be found to ſuccéede Quéene <hi>Mary,</hi> and to preuent the Ladie <hi>Elizabethes</hi> right.</p>
                     <p>All this notwithſtanding it pleaſed God, many of her eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being taken away, that ſhée ſhoulde poſſeſſe the crowne. at what time a man woulde haue thought, they woulde haue ceaſed to purſue her, againſt whom they coulde not preuaile. Yet euen then did they alſo ſhew their malice: and firſt they cauſed the Quéene of Scots to claime the crowne, &amp; to beare the armes of England. Then by the way of Scotland the French began to threaten and to inuade her countrey, and had procéeded further, but that her Maieſties forces did ſhut them vp in Léeth.</p>
                     <p>Not long after followed the excommunication of pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fift, and the rebellion in the north parts of England. After that <hi>Nicholas Sanders</hi> ſtirred vp a rebellion in Ireland. And this <hi>N. D.</hi> their proctor albeit hée woulde excuſe and cléere the papiſts of all euill meaning, yet coulde hée not forbeare to praiſe the rebels, and lament their death; which ſheweth how well rebellion and treaſon doth pleaſe this faction, and howe little hée loueth her Maieſtie, with whoſe capitall enimies hée is ſo néere conſorted.</p>
                     <p>When by ſedition and rebellion they could not preuaile, hey ſtirred vp <hi>Philip</hi> king of Spaine to make open warres vpon her Maieſtie, to depriue her of her kingdome. Neither did either reſpect of alliance, or ſhame, or danger drawe him backe from this enterpriſe. The duke of Alua had giuen the firſt attempt, had not the vnexpected troubles of the low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries hindred him. And <hi>Don Iuan D'Auſtria</hi> had not failed to make warres vpon vs, but that God cut him off in the midſt of his deliberations. The yéere 1588. the Spaniard brought a great fléete vpon this coaſt; and to correſpond with it, there were great lande forces prouided by the duke of Parma in the Low countries. Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> was then readie alſo to vtter and throw abroad his excommunications, and ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous<note n="a" place="margin">His letters to the nobility and people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> libels againſt her Maieſtie, and the ſtate. Neither
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:177777:45"/> could the euill ſucceſſe of that iourney make the Spaniard giue ouer his determination.</p>
                     <p>Beſide rebellion and warre, they haue attempted poyſon and ſecret practiſes to deſtroy her. <hi>Iohn Someruile</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to kill her, by a ſeditious prieſt. The ſame execution did <hi>William Parry</hi> take vpon him perſwaded by <hi>Benedict Palmio,</hi> and <hi>Aniball Codret</hi> two Ieſuits. <hi>Ballard</hi> a prieſt by his lewd perſwaſion drew <hi>Babington, Sauadge, Tichborne,</hi> and their companions to conſpire her death. By the meanes of <hi>Holt</hi> a Ieſuite, <hi>Gifford, Worthington,</hi> and of certaine prieſts, <hi>Yorke, Williams, Patrick Collen,</hi> and others were ſent ouer vpon the ſame errand. And when with the ſworde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing coulde bée done, <hi>Lopez</hi> by certaine traitors was hired, and <hi>Squire</hi> by <hi>Walpoole</hi> was perſwaded to poiſon her. And no queſtion, but many other attempts haue béene made againſt her, although they are not come to light hitherto. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I thinke was one poore Ladies life more ſought, nor by more meanes. They haue left neither force nor fraud, nor any courſe vnattempted.</p>
                     <p>Nay not content héerewith, <hi>They haue</hi>

                        <hi>curſed all her ſubiects and friends,</hi> ſeaſed the perſons and goods of ſuch as they coulde come by, and by all meanes ſought to ouerthrow the ſtate. anno 1588. diuers rinegued Engliſh, and among the reſt the traiterous Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> came with the Spaniards to fight againſt their countrey. From time to time they runne to the enemie, bewray their countries ſecrets, and diuers of them euen now intertaine intelligence with the Spaniard.</p>
                     <p>And little it is, God wot, that our aduerſarie, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all his great ſhewes, can allege in his clients the papiſts defence. Firſt hée is offended, that ſir <hi>Francis Haſtings</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>That by Gods goodneſſe onely her Maieſtie was preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, her life being maliciouſly and with great cunning ſhot at by the Romiſh clergie, and Spaine againſt her.</hi> And thereupon alledgeth thrée reaſons of her Maieſties deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Firſt ſaith he, <hi>King Phillip and the Spaniards ſpecially fauoured her for her yoong yeeres, beautie, felicitie, and other her good graces and talents.</hi> Secondly hée ſaith, <hi>Shee bore her ſelfe for a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, and heard two maſſes a day, one for the quicke, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the dead, and receiued no ſeruant into her ſeruice lightly, but with expreſſe condition, and many ſignes, that he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:177777:46"/> enclined that way.</hi> Thirdly he imagineth, <hi>That ſhee was kept aliue to barre the next praetender, that then was wife of the Dolphine of France, which for ſome reaſons neither Spaniſh, nor Engliſh could endure.</hi> And theſe reaſons hée eſtéemeth to bée <hi>Very potent, and pregnant:</hi> for ſo hée calleth them. But if wée will rightly eſtéeme them, wée ſhall finde them to be built on falſe grounds, and to bée very impotent, barren of reaſon, and ridiculous.</p>
                     <p>For firſt moſt falſe it is, that the Spaniards ſo fauored her, that they would either hazard their ſtate, or looſe a kingdom for her ſake. All which was like to come to paſſe, if the ladie <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> ſhould atteine to the crowne. And very vnlikely it was that the Spaniſh king, <hi>That ſpared not his</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Vita di Pio quinto.</note> 
                        <hi>owne onely ſonne, nor bloud,</hi> nor thoſe that were far néerer to him, then the <hi>Lady Elizabeth,</hi> woulde encurre the popes diſpleaſure, and looſe his footing in England to ſpare her. But what néede wée diſpute of the Spaniards care and affection to her, when they ſuffred her to be impriſoned, euill intreated, and called in queſtion for her life? As for the Count of Feria, hée came to her indéede, but not for any good intended to her, but either for a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of curteſie, or to aſke ſuch a queſtion of her, as her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtout anſwer maketh this Noddie, albeit hée knew it, aſhamed to report.</p>
                     <p>Secondly her comming to maſſe, if I may ſo call it, when maſſe was ſaide before her, that vnwillingly heard it, was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of conſtraint, then otherwiſe. As for ſeruants, good Lady, ſhe had no power to entertaine any, but her ould ſeruants were remooued, and certaine were forced vpon her, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to attend her, that ſhe liked not. But be it, ſhe had for ſauing of her life, giuen ſome hope of inclining to popiſh religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the aduerſary falſely and diſhonorably imagineth; yet papiſts are not ſo ſimple, as to truſt ſuch, as are newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted. Againe ſéeing the pope had pronounced diuers ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt her, to fruſtrate and make void her right: it could not auaile her any thing to turne to the papiſts, vnleſſe either the pope would reuoke his ſentences, or ſhe take the crowne at his hands, which I doubt whether he would haue giuen to her, if it had béene in his power to diſpoſe. King <hi>Henry</hi> the third of France though ſuperſtitiouſly popiſh, yet might he not liue, for that he was not for the humour of the pope. <hi>Antonie</hi>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:177777:46"/> likewiſe king of Portugall was put beſide his crowne, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his religion, to gratifie the king of Spaine.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly ſéeing Quéene <hi>Mary</hi> was like to haue children at the firſt, it is more likely, that the papiſts ſought to eſtabliſhe the kingdome in Quéene <hi>Mary,</hi> and her ſucceſſion by the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Ladies deſtruction, then to barre another pretender, which could claime no intereſt before Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> death, not then looked for ſo ſoone. Beſides it is not likely, ſéeing the papiſts ſought onely to eſtabliſh their owne kingdome, that they ſhould exclude one, that was wholy deuoted to their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for one either contrary, or much ſuſpected. And if the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes did reſpect the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in regard of matter of ſtate: then did they it not for loue, as is pretended in the firſt potent reaſon. Laſtly it is moſt-falſe to ſay, that the papiſtes ſought to preferre Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> before the Quéene of Scotts. For why then did they ſet her title on foote at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Quéenes reigne? why haue they continuallie ſought to preferre the Scottiſh title, and to diſhable her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties right? To conclude, why did the<note n="a" place="margin">Vita di Pio quinto.</note> pope and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents declare the Scottiſh Quéene to bée the true and lawfull enheritour of the crowne? So it appéereth; that theſe reaſons are of no force to conclude, that the papiſts ment her Maieſtie any good.</p>
                     <p>But why they ſhould purpoſe her hurt and deſtruction, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers moſt forcible reaſons may be alleadged. Firſt they knew, that her title, right and reigne could not ſtand with the popes authority, which is the onely line and leuell of the actions of papiſts, and eſpecially in matters of faith. They knew, I ſay, that pope <hi>Clement</hi> had pronounced ſentence againſt her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mariage with the King; and that pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third had ſeconded him, and declared her illegitimate: which ſentences could not well be retracted. Secondly they conſidered, that ſhe had alwaies béene brought vp in true religion, and hated Romiſh ſuperſtitions. Thirdly diuers feared to be called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt for their iniuſtice and cruelty ſhewed to Gods ſaintes, if ſhe ſhould once attaine to the crowne. Fourthly they feared, leaſt ſhe would remember the wronges, which they had offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to her ſelfe during hir ſiſters raigne. Fiftly they ſaw they ſhould either turne from their Romiſh religion or forgoe their honors, and liuings, and that they meant not to do: they had
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:177777:47"/> ſo farre engaged themſelues already. Laſtly the Spanyards, and Italians, and all the popes agentes ſaw, that if ſhe ſuccée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, their hopes were ended, and that they muſt be packing out of England. Other reaſons alſo may be alleaged to this purpoſe. but what ſhould we ſearch out reaſons to prooue, that a thing was likely to be done, when it plainely appeareth it was doone?</p>
                     <p>Secondly he much miſliketh that Sir <hi>Francis Haſtings</hi> ſhould ſay, that <hi>Her Maieſtie came to the crowne with the good liking of all true harted Engliſhmen both clergie, nobles, and commons, and that then ſatan and his miniſters beganne to fret and chafe.</hi> And what reaſon hath he ſo to do, trow you? Forſooth becauſe, as he ſaith, <hi>Papiſts placed her in poſſeſſion of the crowne.</hi> Which is nothing elſe, but a plaine confeſſion againſt himſelfe, and his clients the papiſts, that they are no true harted Engliſhmen. For if her Maieſtie were placed in her ſeat by all true harted men, then albeit the papiſts concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in that action, yet hath this Noddy no reaſon to take excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to theſe words of his aduerſary. But percaſe he is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that Sir <hi>Francis</hi> ſhould ſay, that the papiſts were angry and fretted inwardly, when they ſaw Quéene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in her kingdome. As if it were not apparent, how much it gréeued them. Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> and ſome other popiſh bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſéeing how matters went, died for ſorow: others fled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſeas; the reſt hung downe their heads being ſick for extreme gréefe. Neither of al the popiſh prelates could any one be founde to celebrate the act of conſecration, but one, albeit it was no ſmall danger and diſloialtie to refuſe to performe it. Hée that had ſéene their faces and countenances that daie, woulde haue eaſily coniectured, how much it gréeued the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts inwardly, and how falſely this falſe frier <hi>N. D.</hi> auouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that they <hi>Placed her freely and willingly.</hi> So willing they ſéemed, that nothing gréeued them more, then that they had ſuffred her to liue. To make his tale ſéeme better, hée ſaith, <hi>That moſt of the nobilitie and commons, and all the biſhops were papiſts, when the Queene came to the crowne.</hi> But hée fouly miſtaketh the matter. For the Papiſticall prelats were no true biſhops, but woolues and hirelings hated for their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie and abominations, of all the people generally; and thoſe of the nobilitie that were in opinion addicted to popiſh religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:177777:47"/> yet were not then factiouſly combined with the pope.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly hée goeth about to anſwere for doctor <hi>Story,</hi> who vpon the Quéenes firſt comming to the crowne, did much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at it, togither with other papiſts, and ſaide, <hi>If they had followed his counſell, they had ſtrooke at the roote:</hi> meaning no doubt her gratious Maieſtie. But if hée had ment to put in an anſwer, that might haue caried colour, &amp; cleered his client from ſuſpicion of treaſon: hée ought to haue vnderſtoode the mans faults and cauſe better, and to haue anſwered particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to euery point of his accuſation. But that, as it ſéemeth he cannot doe, that acquiteth himſelfe ſo badly in this one. Firſt he ſaith, <hi>Theſe wordes were neuer ſpoken by doctor Storie, to his knowledge.</hi> As if nothing coulde be ſpoken by doctor <hi>Storie,</hi> which came not to his knowledge. but ſaith he, doctor <hi>Storie neuer confeſſed theſe wordes.</hi> As if it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie or likely that euery traitor and malicious enimie of the ſtate ſhoulde confeſſe his treaſons, and malicious purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: or as if it were not ſufficient, that being examined vpon theſe words, hée did not denie them, but refuſed to anſwere: which refuſall in that caſe purporteth as much, as a confeſſion. But ſuppoſe hée ſhoulde haue denied the wordes, yet might he haue béene conuinced by diuers witneſſes that heard him ſpeake them. Hée ſaith further, that doctor <hi>Storie had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſpeake any ſuch wordes.</hi> As if a man neuer did, nor could do any thing, but by reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Secondly hée woulde willingly mollifie <hi>Stories</hi> wordes by a gentle interpretation, and woulde make vs beléeue, that <hi>By ſtriking at the roote,</hi> hée ment not rooting out of Quéene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but rather puniſhing certaine great men fauorers of heretikes (for ſo they terme true catholikes) and for proofe of this hée alleageth, how <hi>Story</hi> on a certaine time was in a great chafe, becauſe hée coulde not bée ſuffred to apprehende a certaine gentleman, and cut his throte at his pleaſure, and ſaide, hée woulde no more ſerue as an Inquiſitor, if he ſhoulde be ſo croſſed. But both the anſwere and the proofe is nothing, but vaine trifling. For who can doubt, but hée ment her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, ſeeing otherwiſe hée had giuen counſell to take away her life; and at that time talked of no other? Againe, what roote coulde hée vnderſtande but her, that was the roote and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that ſtate, which coulde not ſtande with the kingdome
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:177777:48"/> of poperie and Antichriſtianiſme? As for thoſe gentlemen, that this fellow ſpeaketh of, they were neither the roote, nor the great boughes of our religion.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly granting that <hi>Storie</hi> had ſo ſpoken and ment, yet he ſaith <hi>That there was no reaſon, why he ſhould therefore be executed as a traytor, for that he ſpoke thoſe wordes, as a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor to his prince.</hi> But firſt he muſt vnderſtand, that the queſtion is not, whether <hi>Story</hi> was iuſtly executed, or no; but whether the papiſts did not ſeeke the Queenes moſt innocent blood. And this wiſe diſputer doth in effect yéelde ſo much, and confeſſe that Doctor <hi>Story</hi> ſpoke theſe wordes, and that this was conſulted vpon in councell in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> daies.</p>
                     <p>Secondly it appeareth by the ſtory of Doctor <hi>Stories</hi> triall and arraignment, that he was not called in queſtion for theſe wordes, but for high treaſon: and that moſt iuſtly. For firſt he ranne ouer to the D. of Alua, and other the Quéenes enemies, and ſought how to ſtir them vp to make warre againſt his prince, and country. Secondly he practiſed with one <hi>Preſton</hi> &amp; <hi>Paine</hi> how to make ſome inſurrection in England. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he entertained intelligence with fugitiue rebels, and knowne enemies of this ſtate. Beſide treaſons there was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected to him, that he had by vertue of his inquiſitors office in Flanders brought diuers of his countrymen in danger, and made great ſpoile of their goods. And ſo euident and plaine were the matters obiected againſt him, that he had no other ſhift, but to denie himſelfe to be a ſubiect, and to refuſe to be iuſticed by the lawes of this land; which pleading, I thinke, his aduocate here will confeſſe to be moſt ridiculous.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly it cannot be denyed, but the wordes were ſpoken not onely in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> time, but alſo in this Quéenes time. For he was not charged with ſaying, <hi>If you ſhall follow;</hi> but, if you <hi>had followed mine aduiſe:</hi> Lamenting, that when they might, they had not followed his aduiſe in deſtroying the Quéene.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly albeit he had béene charged onely with thoſe words, which by his enditement, by the euidence then giuen, and by diuers witneſſes yet liuing is refuted; yet to imagine or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the princes death, is treaſon by all lawes. This our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie therefore, that ſaith, doctor <hi>Storie was condemned by ſhoutes and clamors, as Chriſt was before Pilate:</hi> blaſphemeth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:177777:48"/> in comparing a notorious traitor, and a bloudie perſecuter of Chriſts flocke to the moſt méeke and innocent lambe of God Chriſt Ieſus. And where he confeſſeth, that <hi>The papiſts thinke that Storie for his zeale in Queene Maries time, is to receiue a great crowne of glorie, and fame vpon earth:</hi> he ſheweth both his owne, and other papiſts moſt cruell and bloodie minde, that allow of doctor <hi>Stories</hi> murdrous and cruell intentions both againſt her Maieſtie, and other godly men: and declareth what fauour we are to looke for at his hands, if once hée and his conſorts coulde haue but a finger in gouernment. As for doctor <hi>Storie,</hi> hée hath now receiued his rewarde, but not of glorie, vnleſſe hée did repent himſelfe of his hereſie, and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; of which he gaue ſmall tokens at his death.</p>
                     <p>After doctor <hi>Stories</hi> matter, he toucheth the cauſe of <hi>Pius quintus</hi> his preſumptuous excommunication denounced moſt iniuriouſly againſt her Maieſtie: but very daintily and nicely, not daring to miſlike it for offending his holy father the pope; nor daring to allow it, leaſt hée ſhoulde ſéeme to concurre with thoſe publike enimies, that ſéeke to take away her honour, crowne, and life. Gladly hée woulde excuſe the papiſts his cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, but his pleading is ſo fonde, and fooliſh, that their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies cannot deſire plainer euidence to accuſe them &amp; conuict them. Firſt he ſheweth, and woulde, if hée coulde tell howe, complaine, <hi>That the bull of Pius quintus the pope is made a common bugge againſt papiſts euery where, as if they were guiltie in allowing his fact.</hi> And ſo hée thinketh to ſhift off a foule matter with a fewe faire wordes, and with a <hi>finta,</hi> or fained ſhew of a downe, right blowe, to bobbe or rather abuſe his Reader, that looketh for ſound reaſon. But hée may not thinke, ſéeing hée is come into the fielde, to make a challenge, that hée ſhall ſo eſcape our fingers. Firſt hée ſaith, <hi>That papiſts albeit they admit the popes iuriſdiction, yet are not partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant of the offence giuen by the pope.</hi> But howe doth hée prooue that? Forſooth you muſt take it of his owne bare word. For other law or reaſon he alleageth none. So ridiculous an aduocate doth hée ſhew himſelfe, in the greateſt heat of his cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents cauſe. Hée confeſſeth that papiſts allow the popes iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and néedes muſt hée ſo do, or elſe they ſhoulde not bée papiſts. Héereof wée ſay, that it is neceſſarily inferred, that they are as farre guiltie, as the pope; and no leſſe to be reputed
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:177777:49"/> enimies of the prince and ſtate, then the pope himſelfe. Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> as the world knoweth, diſabled her right, pronounced her excommunicate, depriued her of her kingdome, exhorted not onely forreine princes to make warres, but all her ſubiects to rebell againſt her: finally all ſuch, as ſhould obey her lawes, or helpe her, hée doth no leſſe anathematize, then the Quéene herſelfe. <hi>Praecipinus &amp; interdicimus</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">In Bulla ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſ. Elizab.</note> ſaith hée, <hi>vniuerſis &amp; ſingulis proceribus, ſubditis, populis &amp; alijs praedictis, ne illi einſue monitis, mandatis, &amp; legibus audeant obedire: qui ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus egerint, eos ſimili anathematis ſententia innodamus.</hi> Neither did hée onely giue ſentence againſt her, but alſo prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to depriue her. For this cauſe hée practiſed both with French and Spaniſh, and ſent <hi>Vincent Lauro</hi> biſhop of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deui into Scotland, and <hi>Robert Ridolphi</hi> to make ſome ſtirre in England. Hée raiſed men and ſent money into England, and other places for this purpoſe. So it appéereth that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts muſt neceſſarily allow yea &amp; further the popes hoſtile act, if they ment to acknowledge his authoritie. For otherwiſe themſelues were excommunicate. Beſides, they muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily obey the popes commandement. Neither is it to bée doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that diuers principall papiſts haue entertained intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with the pope, and his agents. Laſtly it is folly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute what papiſts do meane, when wée ſée euidently what they do. Vpon euery occaſion they are ready to rebell againſt their princes, when the pope commandeth. They haue ſhewed it in Ireland, in Scotland, and in England. In France they roſe againſt king <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, that was a man of their owne religion. They profeſſe they are members of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh church; which doth neceſſarily include obedience to the pope. And to conclude, this Noddie confeſſeth they allow of the popes authoritie in depriuing of princes of their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. Wherefore not onely all lawes of nations, but alſo all reaſons of ſtate condemne ſuch for enimies and traitors to the ſtate. And ſtrange it is, that any prince or ſtate can ſuffer ſuch, as either adhere to forreine enimies, or elſe beléeue that a forreine enimie hath power to diſpoſſeſſe the ſupreme magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of his crowne.</p>
                     <p>He ſcorneth Sir <hi>Francis Haſtings</hi> for ſaying, <hi>That no child of mortall man, hath power to diſpoſe of kingdomes, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe princes, or to diſpence with ſubiectes for not obeying their
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:177777:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> prince.</hi> And maketh ſhew of pleading for the popes authoritie in depoſing princes. But firſt we do not here reaſon, what the popes power is; but whether the papiſts that allow his iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction are traitors. Secondly admitte that were the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on héere: yet, I ſay, that the ſaying of ſir <hi>Francis,</hi> as he ment it, is moſt true. For his meaning is, that the pope, that is not onely the childe of mortal man, but a childe of perdition, &amp; the aduerſarie of Chriſt Ieſus, hath no ſuch power, as papiſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, to depoſe princes. And the ſame may bée prooued euen by the examples alleaged in this place, by the Noddie himſelfe. For neither did <hi>Peter</hi> nor <hi>Paul,</hi> which notwithſtanding had a farre greater authoritie, then any pope of Rome, depoſe <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Caligula,</hi> or <hi>Nero:</hi> nor is it founde in holy Scriptures, that any high prieſt of the Iewes depoſed any king, or diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged any ſubiects from their obedience. If hée knew anie ſuch matter done, why doth hée not alleage his author, and the names of the parties? Nay it is not to bée prooued, that anie mortall man can diſſolue the bond of a lawfull oath, or diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null that obligation, that is mutuall betwixt princes and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. Neither is the knight to bée condemned for a prince-ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later, for ſo ſaying. But the knaue his aduerſarie, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts are iuſtly to bée condemned, as pope-idolaters. For not onely they<note n="a" place="margin">C. ſatis dist. <hi>96.</hi>
                        </note> call him in expreſſe termes God, and giue vnto him diuine power in tranſlating of kingdomes; but alſo they acknowledge his iudgements to bée infallible, and ſay that the pope and Chriſt haue but one Conſiſtorie, and the ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and power. At Rome the people and prieſts like beaſtes fall downe and worſhip him, euen as the idolatrous Iſraelites worſhipped the golden calfe in the wilderneſſe. Do you then thinke this man to bée wiſe, that ſo ſlenderly and barely tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth ſo great a matter, which the grand maſters of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ſynagogue with all their learning are not able to prooue? Or may hée bée thought very ſober, where hée taketh on him to ſhew, that papiſts are her Maieſties good friends, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſought her deſtruction, euen there to iuſtifie pope <hi>Pius</hi> his hoſtile actes, that not onely ſought to depriue her of her ſtate, but alſo to deſtroy her; and to confeſſe that they are the popes adherents, and allow his iuriſdiction? howſoeuer wée are to thinke of others, this aſſuredly is moſt apparant, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this railing treatiſe is a profeſſed enimie of the ſtate.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:177777:50"/> For hée doth not onely diſallow all courſes taken for her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties ſafetie, and the ſafetie of this kingdome, but taketh on him to iuſtifie rebels, and to defend publike enimies. Do you not then take this fellow to bée a woorthie mediator to obtaine grace for Recuſants and papiſts? But to leaue to ſhewe his malice and treaſon, that euery where is apparent, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede in our diſcourſe, after hée had in a ſleight manner tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the popes act, hee denieth, that <hi>Engliſh papiſts ſo ſoone as her Maieſtie was in full poſſeſſion of the crowne, began to fret, and chafe, and conſequently to practiſe againſt her.</hi> And his reaſon is, <hi>For that it was twelue yeeres, ere the excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Pius Quintus came out againſt her.</hi> But his defence is voide of truth, his concluſion voide of reaſon. The firſt is apparent not onely by the writings of the papiſts oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her gouernment, &amp; by their flight ouer ſeas, but alſo by the obſtinacie of the prelates, all refuſing to crowne her but one; and by their ſecret conferences &amp; packings both amongſt themſelues, and alſo with the pope and other forreine princes. Neither may wée thinke that the Quéene of Scots did then claime the crowne of England, or that the French ſent ouer forces into Scotland without their priuitie. But of this wée haue alreadie ſpoken. The ſecond is prooued, for that the exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that impious pope was not the firſt cauſe, but the extremitie of the rancor &amp; malice of papiſts. Neither was the ſame procured, but by great ſute and labour, &amp; when all other practiſes failed. Laſtly it is certaine that the rebellion, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter broke foorth in the north was long before plotted, &amp; diuers conſultations had, how to diſpoſſeſſe her Maieſtie of the crowne, and to alter the eſtate. <hi>Sanders</hi> in his ſlanderous and lying treatiſe of Schiſme<note n="a" place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> de ſchiſm.</note> confeſſeth, that the popiſh prelates vpon the firſt alteration of religion, <hi>Had determined to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate the Queene, and enterdite the land;</hi> and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward miſliking that courſe, they referred the matter to the pope, who vpon their ſolicitation procéeded to excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and open hoſtilitie.</p>
                     <p>To prooue that the papiſts were not cauſe of the popes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt England, he is not aſhamed to ſay, <hi>That the Queene began with the pope, and not he with her; and that the pope was incited by Engliſh proteſtants, &amp; not by papiſts, to proceed againſt her.</hi> He affirmeth alſo, <hi>That hee had great
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:177777:50"/> reaſon to take this courſe againſt the Queene and this land,</hi> and that firſt, <hi>for that not onely the body of religion was changed, that had endured a</hi> 1000. <hi>yeeres before, and that contrarie to expectation &amp; promiſe, but alſo diuers ſtatutes made againſt him in opprobrious termes, and the catholike body of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land forced to ſweare againſt him: and ſecondly for that the prelates adhering to the pope were therefore all depriued, and ſome of them impriſoned.</hi> And <hi>Thirdly, for that papiſts were inhibited to flie the realme, and theſe that remained were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to participate not onely theſe othes, but alſo to eate new ſacrament-bread againſt their conſciences.</hi> And <hi>Fourthly, for that the pope was traduced in pulpits and ſchooles as anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and ſcoffed at in plaies as author of many ridiculous fooleries.</hi> And laſt of all, <hi>For that this change was an example to countries round about vs to attempt the like.</hi> In which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe there are many weake reaſons, and diuers ſtrong and impudent leaſings. For firſt albeit ſome occaſion had béene giuen by vs to mooue the cholericke popes to anger, yet doth it not follow, that they had iuſt cauſe of anger: nor that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts did not ſtirre vp the coles, and enflame their wrath againſt vs. Secondly admit princes ſhoulde offende either againſt Religion or iuſtice; yet neither hath the pope, nor any biſhop any authoritie to depoſe them from their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. Chriſt gaue his apoſtles no ſuch power. Nay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe challenged no earthly kingdome. The apoſtles taught no ſuch doctrine. Nor did the holy biſhops of the ancient church euer claime any ſuch iuriſdiction. Nay the popes themſelues before <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeuenth did not preſume either to depriue princes, or to meddle with their kingdoms. But if the tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny &amp; impietie of princes grew vnſufferable, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was the ſame ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther redreſſed in the parliament, &amp; aſſembly of the eſtates of the realme, or elſe by ſome y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had lawful power by the cuſtome of the countrey. As for the popes claime, it is not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all antiquitie, but to rules of ſtate; and ſo abſurd, that men in greateſt blindnes of antichriſts kingdome could not endure it. For what can be deuiſed more abſurd, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald frier, or a humorous Italian, ſhould take on him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe princes of other countries? Thirdly what reaſons ſoeuer forreine tyrrants pretend to offer violence to chriſtian princes, yet that is no excuſe for the ſubiects, either to enter into diſloial
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:177777:51"/> practiſes, or elſe to allow their tyrannicall and vniuſt preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And therefore all this talke about the popes furious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications, and other acts of hoſtilitie is méerely imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, where the encounter and contention is about the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of papiſts, that ſhoulde ſhewe themſelues ſubiects. Fourthly the pope had no reaſon to complaine, that popiſh prelates for adhering to him were reſtreined. For no ſtate may ſuffer ſuch to enioy their libertie, as adhere to forreine enimies. Nor do the popes ſuffer their Cardinals or friers to adhere to others, whom they accompt their enimies. Fiftlie what had the pope to do withall, albeit the Quéene for cauſes did forbid her ſubiects to depart the countrey? Hath the prince no intereſt in his ſubiect, but he may forſake him at pleaſure? The pope will not I thinke giue his people that libertie. And if he will not giue that to his owne ſubiects; what reaſon hath he to require it in other princes ſubiects? Laſtly the pope ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his authoritie refuted in diſputations, he ſhould rather in ſchooles and pulpits haue taught the truth, then with armes in open fielde ſought to ouerthrow the truth, and the ſtate both togither. If hée were prooued to bée antichriſt by ſcriptures, he ſhoulde by like courſe haue anſwered. The apoſtles neuer ſought to eſtabliſh their authoritie by force of armes, nor by violence to plant religion. The pope therefore doing contrary, ſheweth himſelfe to be antichriſt, and Mahomets, rather then the apoſtles ſucceſſor.</p>
                     <p>The leaſings contained in this allegation are likewiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and ſhameleſſe. To ſay that the Quéene began with the pope, is not onely falſe, but alſo a moſt vaine and ridiculous conceite. For it is well knowne, and teſtified by record, that he did perſecute her in the perſon of her parents, when ſhe was yet in the wombe, when ſhe was newly borne, and ſithence continually: whereas her Maieſtie onely medled with her owne kingdome without reſpect to the pope, which hath no more power ouer her Maieſtie or other chriſtian princes, then the great Turke. For both their authorities are alike forced and vſurped.</p>
                     <p>Secondly it is a ſhameleſſe vntruth to ſay, <hi>That the body of religion that had endured here aboue a thouſand yeeres, ſhould now be changed by vs.</hi> Let the Noddy, or becauſe he is but a ſilly diuine, and taketh vp all at the ſecond and third
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:177777:51"/> hand, let the proudeſt of that ſide ſhew, if they canne, that we haue altered any one article of the chriſtian faith, or aboliſhed one iot of the apoſtles doctrine. As for the priuate maſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out communion, and the communion vnder one kind, and the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, adoration of the ſacrament, worſhip of angels, ſaintes, images, and rotten bones and rags, and other hereſies and nouelties which the papiſts haue more then we; they are not onely beſide, but alſo contrary to Chriſt and his apoſtles doctrine, and the faith of chriſtes church, as our teachers haue heretofore ſhewed, and we ſhall be able ſufficiently to iuſtifie in any frée and lawfull councell and méeting againſt the ſtouteſt champions of the popes ſide.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly eyther muſt he bring proofe of a promiſe made to the pope, that no alteration ſhould be made in religion by her Maieſtie, or elſe he will reſt conuicted of another groſſe lie. As for the woluiſh prelates it is not greatly materiall, what they promiſed. For in king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight his dayes they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to maintaine the kings royall authority againſt the pope. Wherein <hi>Gardiner, Bonner,</hi> and <hi>Tonſtall</hi> were principall agents; yet did they reſpect their honeſt faith, and true promiſe no more, then if they had ſayd nothing.</p>
                     <p>The fourth lie made here, is, <hi>That ſtatutes were made againſt the pope with the moſt ſpitefull and opprobrious words that malice could deuiſe.</hi> For thoſe ſtatutes which he meaneth were made rather for reſtoring the princes right vſurped by the pope, contrary to law, and reaſon; then directly againſt the pope. Againe albeit ſome tearmes vſed in the ſtatutes ſéeme ſharpe, yet come they ſhort of the popes deſert. To accuſe the whole ſtate of malice, and ſpite for inueighing againſt the pope, this fellow had no reaſon, were he not a profeſſed enemy of his country, and a ſlaue to the pope, and Spanyard, and other publike enemies of this ſtate.</p>
                     <p>The fift lie is, <hi>That the whole body of England was forced to ſweare againſt the pope.</hi> For not any one man (ſo farre is he ſhort of the whole land) was forced to ſweare againſt the pope, albeit he was neuer ſo worthy to be abiured, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted. Onely thoſe that deſire either dignities in church and ſchooles, or publike offices in the common wealth are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to take the oathe for the mainteinance of the Quéens

                     <p>The ſixt lie is, <hi>That all the popiſh prelates and clergie were depriued of liuings and libertie, and committed to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and there continued to their dying day:</hi> His owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if he haue any conſcience, can conuince him of it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite witneſſes teſtifie, and diuers records prooue the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For diuers of the popiſh clergie fled-ouer ſea, as <hi>Cutbert Scot, Goldwel, Maurice</hi> elect of <hi>Bangor</hi> and diuers others. Some changed copy and reteined their liuings. Diuers died before they were depriued, as <hi>Hopton</hi> of Norwich, <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorſon</hi> of Chicheſter, <hi>White</hi> of Wincheſter, and many more. Of the reſt ſome were neuer in priſon, as <hi>Oglethorp,</hi> &amp; <hi>Poole,</hi> others were reſtreined to their own houſes, as <hi>Heath</hi> of York, <hi>Bane</hi> of Lichfeld. <hi>Thurlby</hi> and <hi>Watſon</hi> remained in the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops houſe at Lambith. <hi>Bourne</hi> and <hi>Troublefeld</hi> deliuered out of the Tower died at their friends houſes. Such is the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of her Maieſtie, and the mildeneſſe of our religion.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>7.</hi> lie is, that papiſts that <hi>Did not flie the land, nor were impriſoned, were forced to participate our ſacraments,</hi> Which this impious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion calleth <hi>New deuiſed ſacrament bread:</hi> and ſaith, <hi>It was anathematized by the Lutherans the firſt founders</hi> (as hée writeth) <hi>of our religion.</hi> A lie compoſed of diuers vntruths. For firſt wée enforce none to our religion: Nay there is no penall ſtatute againſt thoſe, that receiue not the Sacraments: the more pittie. Secondly hée cannot ſhew where the churches of Germany haue either anathematized or condemned our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion. Laſtly wée do affirme and offer to prooue againſt the whole rable of Ieſuits and friers, that the ſacraments of our church which this ſcornfull wretch ſo impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reiecteth, are moſt conſonant to Chriſt his inſtitution, and the practiſe of the apoſtolike and catholike church. But the blaſphemous maſſe, the halfe communion, the idolatrous worſhip of the bread of the altar, the aboliſhing of bread out of the ſacrament, the popiſh prieſthoode, the popiſh ſacraments, neither can they bée prooued, nor will they be ſo defended, but that the doctrine of papiſts and their practiſe will alwaies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péere to bée contrarie to Chriſt his inſtitution, and the doctrine of the catholike church: and therefore moſt woorthie to bée
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:177777:54"/> aboliſhed and anathematized.</p>
                     <p>It is falſe alſo, <hi>That the pope was by vs made a matter of ſcorne, or that this propoſition, viz. That the pope is antichriſt, and ſuch like, are matters ridiculous.</hi> For ſuch propoſitions we take to be moſt true, and dare alwaies maintaine them againſt more valiant diſputers, then this Noddy euer will be. And therefore we do not thinke the pope a man to bée ſcorned, but a tyrant to bée ſeriouſly ſhunned and abhorred of all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Let this then make the eight lie.</p>
                     <p>This is alſo a lie moſt palpable and groſſe, <hi>That other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fearing harme, that might enſue of the alteration of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in England, complained heereof to the pope, and that hee proceeded againſt the Queene vpon their complaints and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> Let him if hée can ſhew theſe pretended complaints. If hée cannot ſhewe them, let him at the leaſt prooue them, by ſome witneſſe, or record. If not then do I not doubt, but hée will prooue himſelfe a vaine iangler. Which appéereth alſo by this, that <hi>Sanders</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> de ſchiſm.</note> ſaith, <hi>The pope proceeded at the inſtance of Engliſh prelates, that referred the matter to him.</hi> Beſide that, the pope is not ſo dull in working miſchiefe, that hée née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the ſolicitation of others to ſtirre him. Nay it is cléere, that pope <hi>Pius</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Vita di Pio quinto.</note> ſtirred vp both <hi>Philip</hi> of Spaine, and the French men againſt vs. And the like induſtrie did <hi>Paul</hi> the third vſe in ſtirring vp warres and rebellions againſt <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight king of England, and drawing troubles vpon the princes of Germanie. No man therefore hencefoorth can iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doubt, but that all thoſe practiſes, which haue béene lately made againſt her Maieſtie haue procéeded principally from the popes malice and rancor againſt true religion, and the profeſſors thereof; and next from the malcontentment, and trecherie of papiſts and their agents. Theſe are the two foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, from whence all our warres, rebellions, treaſons, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to murder and poiſon princes, and other great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and other ſuch like vilanous practiſes againſt the ſtate haue flowed.</p>
                     <p>Now leaſt any ſcruple might remaine in mens mindes, hée endeuoureth to ſhewe how farre the excommunication of <hi>Pius quintus</hi> toucheth the papiſts in England, and ſaith, that <hi>They are not to diſcuſſe the queſtion betwixt the Queene and the pope, but to loue the one and the other.</hi> But this reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:177777:55"/> is ſo vnſufficient, that it doth rather encreaſe, then diminiſh our doubt. For how can any good ſubiect loue him, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the deſtruction of his prince? How can a man ſerue, not two maſters, but two maſters ſo contrarie, and adhere to a religious Quéene, if hée bée a vaſſall to antichriſt? Beſide this, ſéeing papiſts make the pope the ſouereigne iudge of theſe matters, what a ridiculous conceit is it to thinke, that a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt can iudge otherwiſe, then the pope iudgeth or ſentenceth? His reaſons alſo are ſuch as can ſatiſfie none of any meane vnderſtanding. Firſt ſaith hée, <hi>This excommunication is an act of iuriſdiction betwixt two ſuperiors.</hi> As if it were not méere foolerie to ſay, that iuriſdiction can bée exerciſed betwixt ſuperiors, or betwéene equals. And if papiſts grant that the pope is ſuperior to the Quéene, then muſt they adhere to him, and forſake her. Which no doubt they will do, and muſt doe, if order bée not taken with them. Beſides wée deny that this excommunication is an act of iuriſdiction, or iuſtice. Nay the worlde ſéeth, it is a méere act of vilany, and preſumptuous ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, for a ribald like companion, and a louſie frier to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to depoſe a prince; and a moſt notorious foolerie to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the popes of Rome who haue no right in that, which they iniuriouſly poſſeſſe, haue power to take away the right which belongeth to others.</p>
                     <p>Secondly hée ſaith, <hi>That vpon the popes excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt a prince, the ſubiects conſent was neuer asked nor admitted.</hi> Why then doth the pope excommunicate all thoſe, that after his excommunication adhere to her Maieſtie? Are not his<note n="a" place="margin">In bulla Pij <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. aduerſ. Eliz.</note> wordes plaine? Howbeit I confeſſe, that if rightly we will eſtéeme of matters, the popes excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is no excommunication, he being an vſurper and no iudge in this caſe. And therefore all true ſubiects are to account of his excommunication, as of a denuntiation of his malice, and an argument of his ſhamefull dealing againſt Chriſtian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces contrarie to all precedents of antiquitie: and to eſtéeme them all not onely ſlaues of Antichriſt, but enimies of the eſtate, that ſhall not plainly condemne it, as wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. But if the excommunication ſhoulde bée lawfull, yet are Chriſtians to know it, and allow it, for that it bindeth not, before it bée publiſhed, and allowed.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly he ſaith, <hi>It is no new thing for popes to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:177777:55"/> princes. And that the ſubiect is not to be troubled for his old receiued beleefe about the popes authoritie.</hi> But hée is much deceiued, in things new or old. In faith and beléefe all is new, that is not taught by Chriſt and his apoſtles. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnleſſe hée can ſhewe this authoritie to be giuen from Chriſt, hée muſt néedes confeſſe the Romiſh faith therein to be new. Nay hée cannot ſhew, that the popes either claimed, or practiſed any ſuch power, as to excommunicate and depoſe princes, before <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeuenth, that was therefore right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Hell-brand, or the firebrand of the diuell, to ſet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord betwixt Chriſtian princes, to the weakening and vtter ouerthrow of Chriſtendome, and enlarging of the Turkiſh empire. <hi>Otho Friſingenſis,</hi> and <hi>Trithemius,</hi> and hée that wrote the life of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth emperour, do all teſtifie, that hee was the firſt that attempted to excommunicate princes, and that at the firſt his excommunications were little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly hée telleth vs, that <hi>The ſubiect is not to diſcuſſe, whether the pope had iuſt cauſe to excommunicate the prince:</hi> which altogither ouerthroweth his clients the papiſts cauſe, &amp; declareth them to be vtter enimies to the prince excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. For if they may not diſcuſſe the popes procéeding, but to beléeue, that in his iudicial ſentences hée cannot erre, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in matters of faith: then muſt they of force beléeue, that the pope hath done well to excommunicate their Queene, and muſt aide him to execute it without further enquirie; which teacheth vs without further enquirie alſo, that all papiſts that allow the popes authoritie in excommunicating the Quéene are enimies, if they bée forreiners; and traitors, if they be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly he referreth his clients the papiſts of England, to conſider what the papiſts of France did of late, when their kings were excommunicate; and to Engliſh, that liued in king <hi>Iohns</hi> time. Which plainly argueth, that though hée woulde haue them looke ſmoothly for the time; yet when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſerueth, hée cloſely ſignifieth that they ought to rebell againſt their princes. For ſo did they of the league in France: and ſo did the ſubiects héere in England againſt king <hi>Iohn.</hi> And generally all papiſts are bound to beléeue, that the popes excommunications are to bée executed; and this is their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:177777:56"/> doctrine. But ſuppoſe our aduerſarie ſhoulde teach pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts to contemne the popes authoritie, which hée is not like to do; yet would not his exhortation worke any effect. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies vpon the popes excommunication haue wars and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions enſued, where the pope hath had any authoritie. This was the beginning and motiue of the bloody warres of the popes againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth and fift, and the two <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericks,</hi> and againſt <hi>Otho, Philip,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> of Bauier empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of Germanie. And no other cauſe can be aſſigned of the inſurrections againſt king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, &amp; other excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate princes. In vaine therfore doth this Noddy go about to reconcile the ſubiects obedience with the exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munications of the pope. They neuer did, nor euer coulde agrée hitherto. Fire and water may percaſe bée reconciled; but theſe two cannot. Neither do I thinke, that hée meaneth to reconcile them. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hée deſireth ſome reſpite, vntill by our negligence, either the papiſts may get a head, or forreine enimies haue made their prouiſions ready. For how little affection hée beareth to the prince and ſtate, it appéereth throughout all his defence.</p>
                     <p>In this place hée goeth about to ſmooth, and as farre as hée dare with the ſafetie of the cauſe in hand, to defende the inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in the north of England anno <hi>1569.</hi> the rebellions in Ireland, the practiſes of <hi>Charles Paget,</hi> and <hi>Francis Throg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton,</hi> and diuers other attempts againſt her Maieſtie and the ſtate. Whereas the earles of Northumberland and Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merland roſe in armes in the north, and ſpoiled all that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and purpoſed not onely the deſtruction of the prince, but alſo the ſubuerſion of the ſtate, and the bringing in of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as appéereth by the negotiation of <hi>Ridolpho,</hi> as it is ſet downe in pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fift his life. hée ſaith, <hi>They onely ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>heir tenants togither, and without battaile or bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed retired.</hi> As if they had ment nothing, but to méete at an ale-ſtake or May-game. Doctor <hi>Sanders</hi> raiſed a rebellion in Ireland. <hi>Francis Throgmorton</hi> not onely reuealed the ſecrets of the ſtate to <hi>Bernardin Mendoça,</hi> and practiſed with him, how to draw in forreine enimies; but alſo had his finger in other treaſons. <hi>Charles Paget</hi> began a practiſe about the coaſt of Suſſex, &amp; was the ouerthrow of <hi>Henry</hi> earle of Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, and afterward continued practiſing what miſchéefe he could againſt his countrey. The late earle of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:177777:56"/> actions were openly declared in the Starre-chamber to be dangerous. The laſt earle of Arundell was taken, as hée was paſſing ouer to the enimies. And yet all theſe treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and dangerous practiſes are by him either lightly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or elſe coloured.</p>
                     <p>Hée ſaith, that <hi>Francis Throgmorton died for hauing a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of ſome portes in his chamber.</hi> But his owne confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion teſtifieth, that hée was touched for far greater matters: and I haue partly pointed at the ſame. Hée ſaith <hi>The earle of Arundell was condemned onely for hearing of a maſſe: and that he had cauſe to reioice, that he was condemned for ſuch a treaſon.</hi> As if it were ſo ſpirituall and glorious a matter to heare a maſſe. Aſſuredly in times paſt maſſes were no ſuch glorious matters, when they were ſolde to all commers for thrée-halfe-pence a péece and vnder. As for the earle, hée had great cauſe to commend the clemencie of this gouernment, or elſe hée had well vnderſtoode, that hee had committed greater faultes then hearing of a maſſe: all which I forbeare to relate for the reſpect I beare to his houſe.</p>
                     <p>The iuſtice that hath béene doone vpon papiſts that haue béene conuicted eyther of rebellion, or ſecrete practiſes with forraine enemies, or other kindes of treaſon and felony, he calleth <hi>Preſſures, vexations, diſhonors, rapines, ſlaughters, and afflictions:</hi> Diſhonoring her Maieſtie and the ſtate, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniating the iudges. And yet were more true catholickes and religious chriſtians executed within one yéere in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time, then trayterous papiſts ſince her Maieſtie came to the crowne.<note n="a" place="margin">Hiſtor. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuenſ. lib. <hi>23.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Bizarus</hi> and other ſtrangers do greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend her Maieſties clemency, her very enemies could neuer appeach her of cruelty. The papiſts moſt cruelly murder thoſe, that are of a diuers religion. albeit they yéelde obedience to their prince, and deſire to liue quietly. Her Maieſtie executeth none to death for popiſh religion. nay leaſt ſhe ſhould ſéeme to touch any for religion, ſhe doth oftentimes ſpare offendors guiltie of dangerous practiſes and treaſons. Likewiſe in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the obſtinate to the church there is great moderation vſed. Many offend: few are puniſhed, and that very gently. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes haue the greateſt part of the wealth of the land in their handes. Diuers rayling companions are ſtill publiſhing libels to the diſhonor of her Maieſtie, and the whole gouernment;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:177777:57"/> neither can this Noddy repreſſe his malitious affection, but he muſt néedes allow their dooings. And yet the papiſtes are ſpared; although neuer the more for his wiſe pleading.</p>
                     <p>Finally he commendeth the papiſtes for their patience. But I thinke he meaneth the patience rather of Lombardes, then of chriſtians. For they neuer had yet patience, but when they were vnable to reſiſt. In king <hi>Henry</hi> the eightes dayes they made diuers inſurrections in England. The trumpets of ſedition were monkes and friers. In king <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt his daies they ſtirred in Deuonſhire and Cornewall, and all for want of their maſſe, and holywater, and ſuch like trinckets. The chéefe moouers thereof were likewiſe prieſts. in Quéene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time they made head firſt in the north parts, and afterward in Ireland. by the ſeditious practiſes of prieſtes and Ieſuites either moſt, or a great part of that country is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion. Neither haue they omitted any opportunity, to mooue new rebellions in England. In Fraunce they conſpired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againſt their lawfull kings <hi>Henry</hi> the third and fourth; and neuer gaue ouer, vntill they were ouercome by famine, ſword and other calamities. and this is the patience of papiſts. nay they ſay, that if the firſt chriſtians had had power, they would haue depoſed <hi>Nero, Diocleſian,</hi> and other perſecutors.<note n="a" place="margin">Lib. <hi>5.</hi> de pontif.

                        <hi>genere:</hi> that is of the kinde of crooked clawed beaſtes, but that was couered with his gowne and ſlippers. His firſt ſtep out of the vniuerſity was into the Cardinals houſe, where he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Cardinals pride, and vanity. His firſt employment was in the negotiation at Rome about the kinges mariage with the Lady <hi>Anne Bollen,</hi> who ſent him thither together with <hi>Edward Fox</hi> to ſolicite her cauſe. For his wit and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, he was thought fit to be employed, and ſpecially named by the Quéene: but his falſe and treacherous dealing in that cauſe, did much hinder the kinges procéeding, as afterward did manifeſtly appeare. Notwithſtanding becauſe the Quéene thought he had taken paines, and dealt faithfully with her; ſhe was the cauſe, that he was nominated by the king, and ſo preferred to be biſhop of Wincheſter. The which that he might ſeeme to deſerue, he did publikely defend the kinges ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority againſt the pope, and by an oath, whereof there is yet a publike act remayning, he forſwore and abiured the pope. afterward taking the opportunity of the kinges hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, he wrought an alienation of the kinges minde from the Quéene, and neuer ceaſed, vntill he brought that innocent La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy vnto her end. and not content herewith he was a ſpeciall inſtrument of that act of parliament, that was made againſt her mariage, and her iſſue. Thus this viper rewarded that good Quéene, by whome he was aduanced. Nouriſh vp dogs and they will bite; ſaue the life of a ſerpent, and he will ſting. Now hitherto <hi>Gardiner</hi> in outward ſhew was a great oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the popes authority, but whether vpon hope of greater preferment by the pope, or diſpleaſure to ſome about the king, afterward he began to harken to the pope. Béeing ſent with Sir <hi>Henry Kniuet</hi> to Ratiſbone to a certaine diet holden by the Emperor there, he was diſcouered to haue made a packe with Cardinall <hi>Contarene,</hi> and from thence wrote letters to the pope. Which the king tooke ſo offenſiuely, that in all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons commonly granted in parliaments, he excepted trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons done beyond the ſeas: meaning no doubt this treaſon of Wincheſter. Returning home now reconciled to the pope, he proued a great perſecutor of true chriſtians. He was the chéefe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:177777:59"/> moouer of the king to ſet out the act of ſix articles, which was the occaſion of ſo many innocents death; and in execution thereof this wolfe was alwaies moſt forward; as contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if the king was aduiſed to reforme any abuſe, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies moſt backeward. In the latter time of the king he was ſo out of his fauour, that he came not in his preſence. And where beforetime he was made one of the tutors to young king <hi>Edward,</hi> and an ouerſéer of king <hi>Henries</hi> will, he was quite daſhed out, and by no meanes could bée admitted again, either to his place, in the kings fauour, or in his will Which procéeded, as may probablie bée coniectured, for that hée was the cauſe of Quéene <hi>Annes</hi> death, which the king toward his latter ende ſo much repented. In the beginning of king <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> daies hée hindred the iourney into Scotland, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer might make for the honor of the yoong king, as appée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by his letters to the Lord Protector. And yet in open termes acknowledged the kings ſupremacie, and once more<note n="a" place="margin">The acts are extant.</note> denied the pope. But vpon the Protectors death, the man ſéeing a ſtorme comming, did obſtinately reſiſt the kinges procéedings, and ſo was woorthily depriued of his biſhopricke, and committed to priſon. But béeing deliuered from thence by Quéene <hi>Marie,</hi> hée raged againſt the flocke of Chriſt like a woolfe famiſhed, and long reſtrained. And as before hée had cauſed Quéene <hi>Anne</hi> to looſe her life, ſo hée ſought to bring the ladie <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her daughter to deſtruction. Hée was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtrument to examine and entrap the innocent ladie, and by diuers meanes ſought to ſuborne falſe witneſſes, to accuſe her, as an abbettor of <hi>Wyats</hi> inſurrection. And ſo farre hée preuailed, as a warrant was brought to Maſter <hi>Bridges</hi> then lieutenant of the tower, for her execution. Thus had the hope of her happie gouernment béene cut off, if God had not ſtirred vp the lieutenant to make ſtaie of executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vntill the Quéenes pleaſure was further knowne. Hée was alſo the onely man, that proſecuted biſhop <hi>Ridley,</hi> and biſhop <hi>Latimer</hi> to death: inſomuch that expecting newes from Oxford of their executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: hée woulde not dine before hée had heard, that fire was ſet to them. But ſée Gods iudgements vpon the cruell tyrant: euen that ſelfe ſame dinner, in the midſt of his meriment, God ſo ſtrooke him, that hée was carried from the table to his bed, and neuer roſe vntill hée died. So hée raged while hée liued,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:177777:59"/> and raued when hée died. His actions in his life time were odious, his body dying did ſtinke ſo odiouſly, that his ſeruants could not endure it. He woulde not ſuffer the holy martyrs to ſpeake at their death, and therefore God ſtroke him ſo in his toong with ſwelling, that ſometime before his death he was not able to vtter one word. and this was the life and death of this monſter. Of other qualities I will not ſpeake. One of his men ſet out a treatiſe againſt the mariage of miniſters; wherein it ſeemeth his finger was. But much more honeſtie it had béene for him to haue beene maried. Hee wrote diuers things, but hée wrote not onely contrary to himſelfe, but alſo both to papiſts and proteſtants, which his workes now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant do ſhew, refuting notoriouſly the vaine brags, which our aduerſarie maketh of his learning.</p>

                        <hi>William Allen</hi> was borne I know not where, but he was brought vp in the vniuerſity of Oxford, from whence either diſcontented with the preſent gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or elſe induced with hope of better preferment otherwhere, he fled into the low countries, and there became a reader of the popes broken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity. Afterward beeing nouzled among rebels and traytors, he began to teach poſitions of rebellion and treaſon to his countrymen, that came ouer, and ſo inſtructed them, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of his ſcholers prooued maiſters in wilfull diſobedience and treaſon againſt their prince and country. himſelfe<note n="a" place="margin">Jn his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. ad per ſeq.

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould it ſéeme, that any practiſe was made againſt her Maieſtie by the papiſts, but he eyther was a plotter of it, or had vnderſtanding of it. When her Maieſtie ſent aide to the diſtreſſed people of the low countries, he by his peſtilent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions cauſed <hi>Stanley</hi> and his regiment moſt ſhamefully to betray <hi>Deuenter,</hi> nay to betray the honour of his country, and his prince, and to turne to the enemy. And that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be his act, he was not aſhamed publikely in a booke written, to defend this treaſon, and diſhonour. For which cauſe king <hi>Philip</hi> gaue him liuing and penſion, and the pope at length gaue him the title of a Cardinall, and called he was <hi>Cardinall of Saint Martin in Montibus,</hi> to ſhewe that he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:177777:60"/> ſought no low matters, but would flye to the top of the hilles. He was alſo called Cardinall of England, for that he meant to be legate of England, and to betray it to the pope. For theſe baſe ſeruices he was eſtéemed both of the Spaniſh king and pope, but alwaies as a traytor and perfidious enemy to the prince and ſtate. Which as it appeared alwaies, ſo eſpecially in anno 1588. For then was he appointed to come into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with the Spaniſh army for the ſubuerſion, and vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of that, which ſhould haue béene his moſt déere coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Nay it is apparent, that this war was eſpecially ſtirred vp by him and his conſortes at home and abroade. <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi>

This expedition
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:177777:60"/> diſſolued, this hungrie cardinall returned to Rome loden with ſhame and reproch, for that his wicked counſels tooke no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter effect.

Whereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued his death either vpon gréefe, or percaſe ſome other ſecret occaſion. So hatefull was his life, and his death miſerable and ſhamefull. In all his life he ſought the ruine of his natiue countrey, and therefore Gods will was, that he ſhoulde die in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious in a ſtrange countrey. Séeing then theſe were the qualities and proceedings of <hi>Gardiner</hi> and <hi>Allen,</hi> who doth not deteſt the memory of two ſuch wicked monſters? The Noddie in this encounter ſaith what he can both in their excuſe and praiſe: but if he had thought that any woulde haue come againſt him, I beléeue he woulde haue kept ſilence.</p>
                     <p>Hée ſaith firſt, <hi>That none was further from blood and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then Gardiner;</hi> &amp; to prooue it, alleageth <hi>That it proceeded onely from his gentle nature, that ſome of the greateſt prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in Queene Maries time were not called to accompt: and that he laboured to ſaue the Lord Sturton condemned for murdring of Harguill, &amp; the Lady Smith burned for killing her husband, and the duke of Northumberland condemned for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</hi> Further he telleth vs, <hi>How a certaine bracelet came to his handes containing the ſecret of Wyats action, and yet that he neuer vrged the knowledge gotten thereof to the Lady Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths perill, ſhe beeing then an obiect of loue and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rather then of enuy and hatred.</hi> And much idle talke he ſpendeth about theſe matters, but his pleading is of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that his owne friends muſt néedes acknowledge that he wanteth ſhame in auowing notorious vntruthes; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon in alleadging ſuch matters as either make againſt him, or at the leaſt nothing for him. For wherein could he ſhew himſelfe more ſhameleſſe, then in prayſing <hi>Gardiner</hi> for his mildeneſſe and gentle nature, when ſo many particulars, as we haue before ſet downe, do declare him to be moſt cruell and ſauage, not ſparing any, that ſtood well affected to that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which he hated? Beſide that, did he not ſéeke the death of the Lady <hi>Parre</hi> laſt wife of king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, and the Lady <hi>Tyrwhit,</hi> the Lady <hi>Lane,</hi> and Lady <hi>Harbert</hi> her thrée wayting women? Did he not procure the king to ſet his hand
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:177777:61"/> to the articles againſt the Quéene, and meant to haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded further, had not ſhe by her modeſt cariage and anſwers pacyfied the kings anger? It is alſo euident, that he purſued doctor <hi>Barnes,</hi> and diuers other good men euen to the very death. Neither was <hi>Anne Askew</hi> tormented firſt, and then burned without his priuity. Wherefore if diuers principall proteſtantes, as they are called, or rather Chriſtians were not called to accompt; it was rather want of ability then will, that was neuer wanting in <hi>Gardiner</hi> to ſhed innocent bloud. For he that cauſed one Quéene to be ſlaughtered vpon falſe crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and ſought the death of an other, eſpecially ayming at the greateſt, while <hi>Bonner</hi> and his companions were butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the lambes, and leſſer ſhéepe of Chriſtes fold, we may not thinke, that he meant to forbeare any. No either it was the kings pleaſure, that would not haue his ſeruants butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or elſe the ſtrength, or the wiſe cariage of the parties, that kept them out of <hi>Gardiners</hi> hand, that delited in nothing more then bloud.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe it is a notorious vntruth, that eyther by a brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, or by any other ſigne <hi>Gardiner</hi> was able to prooue the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Elizabeth</hi> conſenting to <hi>Wiats</hi> attempt. But if he had but had the leaſt argument of diſloyalty againſt her, ſhe could not haue eſcaped his hands. For albeit there was no colour, yet did he ſeeke to ſuborne witneſſes againſt her, &amp; promiſe life to <hi>Wiat,</hi> if he woulde accuſe her. What likelyhood is there then, if he ſought witneſſes againſt the lady, and that moſt gréedily, that he ſhould conceale an euidence béeing happily found, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſuch a one as might reueale hidden myſteries?</p>
                     <p>Thus our aduerſary groundeth his defence vpon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes. Beſides that he rayſeth his building vpon thinges very impertinent, and which make little for <hi>Gardiners</hi> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite. He ſaith, <hi>He entreated for the life of the Lord Sturton, the Lady Smith, and the Duke of Northumberland.</hi> As if <hi>Phalaris</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> and the moſt bloudy and cruell tyrantes, that euer yet liued, did not ſpare ſome offenders, to whome they bore affection: euen wolues agrée with wolues, and ſerpents do not ſting one another. If then <hi>Gardiner</hi> fauoured male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, whoores, and rebels, and ſuch like, and without remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion proſecuted true Chriſtians; it is apparent, that he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely cruell, and that his cruelty was extended againſt the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:177777:61"/> beſt men. Sure if this diſcourſer, had béene wiſe, he would not haue mentioned the Lord <hi>Sturton,</hi> or the Lady <hi>Smith,</hi> ſéeing no man béeing ſuch as <hi>Gardiner</hi> was, could with any honour ſpeake for them, the one hauing committed a moſt execrable murder vpon <hi>Harguil,</hi> the other hauing killed her owne huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. No doubt ſhe was an honeſt woman, that <hi>Wincheſter</hi> would ſpeake for.</p>
                     <p>He ſaith that <hi>The Lady Elizabeth was then an obiect of loue and compaſhion, rather then of enuy and hatred.</hi> The which doth argue <hi>Gardiners</hi> extreame cruelty, that had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of conſcience to ſhed ſo innocent a Ladies bloud, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all naturall pitty and compaſſion that was due to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of her yeeres, and quality, and in that caſe.</p>
                     <p>Where ſir <hi>Francis</hi> ſaith, <hi>That recuſants ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not profeſſe more loyaltie and loue to Queene Elizabeth and to the ſtate, then Gardiner did to king Henry, and his ſonne king Edward, &amp; to the ſtate then; and yet in the daies of Queene Marie betraied the Queene, and realme into the popes, and Spaniards hands, pulling off his vizor of loue and loyaltie, and ſhewing himſelfe in his naturall likeneſſe and qualities:</hi> The wiſe <hi>N. D.</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth exceptions to his ſayings, and telleth him, that either hée is ignorant of matters then paſſed or elſe willingly telleth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes: and ſo hée entreth into a long diſcourſe concerning <hi>Gardiners</hi> fall, as he calleth it; and the matching of Quéene <hi>Mary</hi> with king <hi>Philip,</hi> &amp; the comming in of the Spaniards, excuſing <hi>Gardiner</hi> for writing againſt the pope, and flatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying, that hée conſented to match the Quéene with the prince of Spaine. but firſt this talke of Recuſants is impertinent in this place, and argueth nothing elſe, but that this point char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon Recuſants, is a bone too hard for him to gnaw, and a matter which had bin better concealed then mentioned in this place; declaring plainly, what we are to expect at their hands, if time ſerue.</p>
                     <p>Secondly it is moſt falſe, that either <hi>Gardiner</hi> did then fal, or commit a fault, when hée ſtoode for the princes ſupremacie againſt the pope, or elſe that hée condemned his dooing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in during king <hi>Henries</hi> daies. Nay when his Secretary <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Gardiner</hi> was executed; he had like himſelfe to haue paſſed the ſame way, had he not confeſſed his fault to the king, and deſired pardon with promiſe of amendement. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:177777:62"/> in king <hi>Edwards</hi> daies being examined firſt, <hi>Whether hee did not beleeue, that the king was iuſtly and ought to bee the head of the church of England, and of the ſynode or conuocation:</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>Whether hee had not authority, to make eccleſiaſticall lawes, for church gouernment;</hi> hée an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to both affirmatiuely. Which ſheweth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this Noddy was ignorant of matters of thoſe times, and not his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. But if i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> writing againſt the pope he did euill, ſure in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing did he well. For this was the onely act, for which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued commendation. To write for the pope, or to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the popes authoritie, is nothing elſe, but vnnaturally to ſubiect this countrey to a ſtranger, and to acknowledge the vſurped power of a tyrant, that is vndoubtedlie Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>In this place alſo the Noddy heapeth vp other lyes vpon the backe of the firſt, adding lies to lies. Hée ſaith, <hi>That Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner was one of the chiefe of ſixteene Counſellers, that were appointed by king Henries teſtament, and earneſt charge of mouth at his laſt howre, to gouerne his ſonne and realme, and that the king earneſtly gaue charge, that no alteration of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhoulde be made during his ſonnes minoritie.</hi> But neither was hée one of the chiefe, nor any gouernour at all. For the king long before his death had daſhed him out of his will, as a turbulent fellow, and not woorthy to haue ſuch a charge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto him. Neither would he be induced at ſir <hi>Anthony Brownes</hi> requeſt to admit him againe to that place. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this <hi>Gardener</hi> was neither preſent when the king died, nor many daies before, being commanded out of his ſight. Thirdly it is moſt notorious, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king dealt moſt earneſtly with <hi>Annibault</hi> the French kings ambaſſadour a little before his death to perſwade his king to eſtabliſh a reformation of religion in France. And therefore this tale of forbidding alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is a méere fiction. Whatſoeuer the king commanded, that certes was to <hi>Gardener</hi> vnknowne, being forbidden the kings preſence. Fourthly how abſurd is it to thinke, that <hi>Gardiner</hi> durſt plead the popes right to the king, when for this onely ſuſpition, that he enclined to the pope, hée had, no doubt, béene called in queſtion, had hée not ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe to the kings mercy? That hée did ſo, is a moſt ſhameleſſe lie; as alſo that hée denied the Kings ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in his ſermon preached before king <hi>Edward,</hi> which this
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:177777:62"/> Noddy affirmeth contrary to all truth. And therefore doth farre better deſerue the title of <hi>Steelebrow,</hi> then his aduerſary. ſure, if he had not béene both ſtéelebrowed, and béetilbrowed, yea and béetilheaded; hée woulde neuer haue béene ſo bolde in affirming ſo many vntruthes without grounde or witneſſe; nay contrarie to all record of ſtorie, and teſtification of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly it is moſt true, <hi>That Gardiner was a principall actor in matching Queene Mary with Philip of Spaine;</hi> which our aduerſarie denieth: and moſt falſe, that the Counſell was deuided about this matter, ſome fauoring the earle of Deuonſhire, others the prince of Spaine; which he affirmeth. That is prooued, for that hée wrote and receiued letters from <hi>Charles</hi> the emperour to this purpoſe; and alſo in that he was a chiefe dealer about the articles agréed vpon, at the time of the mariage; and laſt of all for that the prince of Spaine came firſt to Wincheſter, and was maried by the biſhop, as a man ſpecially fauoring that match. The ſecond point is prooued firſt by the teſtimonie of<note n="a" place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> de ſchiſm.</note> 
                        <hi>Sanders</hi> that ſaith, that all the counſel liked this match in regard of bringing back the church of England to the church of Rome. And ſecondly for that the Quéene made choice of the earle of Deuonſhire herſelfe; and ſuch was her affection, that ſhée had maried him, but that all her Counſell reſiſted it, and deuiſed moſt ſlanderous letters in the emperors name againſt the yoong man. And laſtly for that the yoong earle was ſuſpected for religion, &amp; ſo giuen to his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that he did not himſelfe deſire any ſuch matter, nor if he had deſired it, could he haue bin liked by <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> Neither ſkilleth it whether <hi>Wincheſter</hi> called him his ſpiritual childe, or no. If he did, then was hée an vnkinde ſpirituall father, that gaue counſell to ſende his childe away into Italy, where by a moſt ſhamefull practiſe of this wicked generation he was poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned and made away. Reſteth then that this practiſe of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> to bring in the authoritie of the pope, and tyrannie of Spaniards was moſt dangerous to this ſtate, and ought to be moſt hatefull to this nation. If he did not pleaſe the pope nor emperor neither, as this our aduerſarie pretendeth; then was he odious to all the worlde.</p>
                     <p>His ſermon certes preached at Paules croſſe before the king and Quéene, and popes legat, declared, that as in times
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:177777:63"/> paſt he had vſed his authority to perſecute poore Chriſtians, ſo here he did abuſe gods word to pleaſe the popes agent, and thoſe that fauoured his faction. His text was, <hi>Hora eſt iani nos de ſomno ſurgere;</hi> which is taken out of Saint <hi>Paules</hi> epiſtle to the Romaines. And out of this he went about to ſhew, that ſince the church of England had departed from the ſubiection of the pope, the people had continued, as it were, in a ſléepe: therefore did he conclude, that euery man muſt awake, and returne againe to the pope. as if the apoſtle in thoſe wordes had willed men to ſubmit themſelues, and to returne to the obedience of the pope, and to embrace his moſt vaine ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and his fantaſticall and impious traditions: which, god wot, was no part of the apoſtles meaning. Nay he rather ſpeaketh of the pope <hi>2. Theſ. 2.</hi> where he mentioneth the man of ſinne, that ſhall ſit in the temple of God, and aduance him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aboue all that is called God. And in this place he rather exhorteth worldlinges that are drowned in ſenſuality and pleaſures, and forget God while they follow the vanities of this world, to awake and call themſelues to a ſerious cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirituall matters. For ſecurity and ſenceleſſe ſtupidity is an image of ſleepe, or death rather. And it may very well be applyed to thoſe, that eyther are beſotted with popiſh igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, not knowing any point of Chriſtian faith, or that walke in darkeneſſe of popiſh errors, and will not awake out of their ſenceleſſe ſléepe, and come to the light of Gods word, that is offered to them. For to ſpeake truely, the doctrine of popery is nothing, but a doctrine of darkeneſſe, of ſleepe, of death. But let vs ſée how our aduerſary defendeth this noble ſermon. firſt ſaith he, <hi>It was preached before the king and Queene, the popes legat, the embaſſadors of diuers princes, and a great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> As if many great fooleries, and vaine toyes had not béene declared before great princes, and many auditors. The more were preſent here, the more witneſſes there were of the mans great ſimplicity, in miſtaking; and ſhameleſſe impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in peruerting the ſcriptures.</p>
                     <p>Secondly he telleth vs, <hi>How Gardiners diſcourſe was to ſhew, how long the people of England had runne aſtray, and beene in darkeneſſe of diuiſion and ſtrife.</hi> But firſt he ſéemed himſelfe to be as it were in a ſléepe, when he talked of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſhould haue ſpoken of ſléepe. For betwéene theſe two
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:177777:63"/> there is no ſmall difference. For many awake in the night, and others ſléepe at noone daye. Secondly he committeth no ſmal error, where he calleth the ſeparation from popery, <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of diuiſion and ſtrife.</hi> For he that is ioyned to Chriſt, walketh in light, and they that liue vnder the pope continue in Egyptian darkneſſe. Beſide, this darkneſſe doth rather worke confuſion, then diuiſion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly he ſaith that <hi>Gardiner vttered two thinges that greatly mooued the whole auditory. The firſt was the harty accuſation of himſelfe for his booke de vera obedientia.</hi> Which he vttered wéeping like a great calfe, and as our aduerſary tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, <hi>With ſuch vehemency as he was forced diuers times to make ſome pauſes. And that theſe teares were not feyned,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>It appeared in this, that drawing to his end, he ſaid, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaui cum Petro, exiui cum Petro, ſed nendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amarè fleui cum Petro. The ſecond was a relation how king Henry a litle before his death dealt with him ſecretly and ſeriouſly, to go into Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many to a certaine diet, and there to take ſome courſe, that he might be reconciled to the pope.</hi> But what maketh all this to the true expounding of this text, <hi>Hora eſt iam nos de ſomno ſurgere?</hi> Surely no more, then if he ſhould haue talked of clyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of goates, or ſhearing of ſwine, and ſuch idle fancies as be repreſented to men in their ſléepe. Beſides that here are many vntruthes conteined, of which I haue great cauſe to doubt, whether euer they were vttered in ſo famous and publike an auditory, or no. Firſt it is a moſt ſhameleſſe vntruth, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that euer the king deſired to be reconciled to the pope. his words, his actions, yea all his procéedings, tended to the contrarie: and of this point he was ſo well reſolued, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſought to perſwade others, to renounce the pope, then determined himſelfe to returne to the pope. Finally what coulde be deuiſed more abſurd, then to feine that ſuch a noble and magnanimous prince did voluntarily ſubmit himſelfe to a baſe enimie, which by no force nor perſwaſion, he coulde bée induced to do. Secondly, it is an abſurd thing to thinke, that if the king meant to do any ſuch matter, he would impoſe the charge vpon him, that had written againſt the popes power, and forſworne it, and vntill the protectors death in king <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> daies did acknowledge the princes ſupremacie. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is apparent, that the king long time before his death
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:177777:64"/> ſuſpected him for a ſecret traitor, and coulde no way abide, that he ſhoulde come in his preſence, as the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> and ſir <hi>Anthonie Browne,</hi> the Duke of Suffolke and diuers others teſtified. And therefore if any ſuch thing had béene in the kings head, he woulde rather haue vſed any other, then him. At leaſt he woulde haue declared his minde to ſome of his Counſails beſide <hi>Gardiner.</hi> Fourthly I cannot learne, that euer the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Wincheſter did ſpeake theſe wordes at Paules croſſe. And therefore moſt like it is, they haue béene forged ſince, and fathered vpon him. Laſtly if the king woulde haue any ſuch matter handled, he woulde not haue ſent into Germany, but to Rome: neither néeded hée to haue doubted, but hée ſhoulde moſt willingly haue bin receiued, if he had entended any ſuch ſubmiſſion. Al theſe points therefore ſéeme to haue bin deuiſed by ſome lying companion, &amp; ſtand onely vpon the bare credite of this our wiſe aduerſarie, without proofe of any one witnes or record: and therefore we may well conclude, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing which he fathereth vpon <hi>Gardiner</hi> is a méere lie.</p>
                     <p>In the relation of the firſt thing alſo there are many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes. Firſt whether the auditory were mooued, or no, at the biſhops ſermons; it may be ſome queſtion. That the ſame was not mooued to beléeue the biſhop, if he ſaid as much as is here written, it is moſt certaine, ſéeing the vntruth of his bragges of the kings fauour was ſo notorious. Secondly that <hi>Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> ſhould wéepe for denying the pope, is a moſt ridiculous fiction. Nay rather it ſéemed he wept, that for ſauing his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral honors, was here conſtrayned publikely to deny Chriſt, and to adhere to Antichriſt. Thirdly it cannot be, that <hi>Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> béeing néere his end ſhould ſay thoſe wordes, that are ſet downe by this reporter. For his toong was ſo ſwolne ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before his death, that he was not able to vtter one plaine word. And if he did ſometimes before his death lament his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall with <hi>Peter,</hi> yet could it not be, that he meant of his abiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the pope (for <hi>Peter</hi> denied Chriſt, and not the pope) but of his plaine renouncing of Chriſt, to pleaſe the pope. Fourthly it is ridiculous to thinke, that <hi>Gardiner</hi> was a ſléepe when he wrote his booke, <hi>De vera obedientia.</hi> Nay it was more likely, that he was brought a ſléepe when he liſtned to the popes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantements, and forgetting Chriſt followed the courſe of the world. Laſtly all his wéeping, ſobbing, and ſighing was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfait,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:177777:64"/> and his ſorrow feined onelie to pleaſe the popes le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</p>
                     <p>But ſaith our aduerſarie, <hi>If euer man might take vpon him to talke of a ſleepe or dreame in matters of our common wealth, then might Gardiner do it.</hi> As if it were ſo great a matter to talke of ſléeping. Sure <hi>Gardiners</hi> and this fellowes talke is ſo euill fitted, that they ſéeme to dreame, while they reaſoned of ſléeping; and come not néere that ſléepe, of which the apoſtle ſpeaketh. Philoſophers ſay that ſléepe is a binding of the ſenſes, and that it is rather a time of reſt and quiet, then of trouble and toſſing too and fro. Further in ſléepe men often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do thinke they ſée and féele, which they ſée not, nor féele not. Abſurdly therefore ſhoulde the times of king <hi>Henry</hi> and king <hi>Edward</hi> be compared to a ſléepe, if there were in thoſe times ſuch ſtirres and troubles, as this fellow ſurmiſeth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that, when <hi>More</hi> and <hi>Fiſher</hi> loſt their heades, it was no idle fancie, ſuch as is repreſented vnto vs, when we ſléepe. Neither if the king was ſo much troubled about matters of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as this ſléeping Noddy, or Nodding ſléeper pretendeth, then was he not in a ſléepe. So then the ſimilitude of ſléepe &amp; a troubled ſtate was very vnfit. And yet to fit the ſame he fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, I know not what, troubles in the kings minde about his diuorce, and matters of religion, moſt falſely. For excepting thoſe troubles which the pope ſtirred, and <hi>Gardiner</hi> by his euil counſel procured, there hapned to the king nothing more then ordinary. Nay after his diuorce from his brothers wife his mind was ſetled, and after the abrogation of the popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, both he and his ſubiects receiued great contentment; and his ſtate, great aſſurance.</p>
                     <p>He telleth further, <hi>How Gardiner was wont to ſay of the king, that leauing to loue her, whom by gods and mans lawes he was bound to loue, he neuer loued any perſon hartily after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> But this is not likely, ſéeing <hi>Gardiner</hi> was a principall agent in the kings diuorce, and knew that neyther gods law, nor mans law was againſt it. Nay he knew, that it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt gods law for a man to mary the relict of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that mans lawes alſo forbid it. Laſtly it is apparent, that all that allowed this mariage, ſtood onely vpon the popes diſpenſation, which now all men know not to be worth a ſtraw. Beſide this, all this talke concerning the kings diuorce
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:177777:65"/> is impertinent to the ſermon, and more impertinent to <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diners</hi> text, about which the queſtion is betwixt vs: and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing, but the extreame hatred and malice of the popiſh faction againſt the noble king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, whom vpon euery occaſion, yea and without occaſion they are alwaies ready to traduce: and all becauſe he diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the pope of his vſurped authoritie. This is alſo the roote of their malice againſt Quéene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which hath mooued them to publiſh ſo many ſcurrilous libels againſt her. Neither haue they ſpared that innocent king, the hope of our time ſo vntimely taken from vs, king <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, vnto whom moſt impudently this railing companion doth impute the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and rebellions that were raiſed in his time by certaine ſeditious prieſts and papiſts in Deuonſhire and Cornewall. He vttereth alſo diuers reprochfull ſpéeches againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and vainely braggeth of the antiquitie of popery, whoſe nouelties are now apparent to all the worlde. But what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all this either for the defence of <hi>Gardiners</hi> ſermon, or elſe for the iuſtification of <hi>Gardiners</hi> cruell murdring of Gods ſaints, or for the cléering of him for diuers practiſes both againſt the Ladie <hi>Elizabeth</hi> now Queene, and alſo againſt the ſtate of religion &amp; this realme? Is it not apparent, that this Noddy in the midſt of his long diſcourſe hath loſt himſelfe, and forgot the matter in hand? The matter it ſelfe doth ſhew it. But no doubt we ſhall heare of him againe ſhortly in ſome new practiſe, or rebellion. In the meane while let vs heare what he hath to ſay for his copartener in all treaſon the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Allen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He ſaith, <hi>That the Cardinall, albeit he wiſhed moderation in yoonger men, yet himſelfe might ſpeake his minde freely concerning the popes excommunication againſt the Queene.</hi> As if that were not vnlawfull for him, that was vnlawfull for others; or as if it were not the part of an vnnaturall, diſloyall and impious traytor, ſo to rayle and reuel againſt the Quéene, his country, the ſtate of religion, and all that loue her and the ſtate, as this rinegued and infamous wretch doth in the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the pope <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> his bull againſt his Quéene and country, and in his libels directed to the nobility and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of England and Ireland, which he meant to haue publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed anno 1588. I néed not to touch other writings of his, for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:177777:65"/> that this paſſeth all. nay therein he ſurpaſſeth himſelfe, and all that wrote before him. The Quéene he calleth at his pleaſure, and doth not onely by manifold reaſons diſable her right, but by infinite calumniations endeuour to make her odious to all poſterity, and not onely to her ſubiectes, that now liue. He ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth foorth the Spaniſh forces, and ſtirreth vp all papiſts to take part with them vpon paine of the popes curſe. He ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth at all thoſe, that eyther loue religion, or liue in obebience, or fauour the ſtate. And yet this diſcourſer doth defend his doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein, and ſaith he might do it fréely. And no doubt, but the papiſtes that adhere to the popes authority are of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But will you heare his braue reaſons? <hi>As in a great and noble houſe</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Iarres and breaches falling out betwixt the goodman and the goodwife, their eldeſt children may declare what they thinke with reuerence to both parts: ſo in the church her Maieſtie beeing our mother, and the pope the ſpirituall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to all cacolikes, Cardinall Allen, Sanders, Briſtow, Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and ſuch like, as elder children may ſpeake their mindes as well of the cauſes of the breaches betweene them, as of the right of both parties.</hi> This is the ſumme of his defence; but how vnſufficient, you ſhall eaſily iudge by the ſequele. Firſt it ſtandeth on falſe groundes. Secondly it conteineth ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous matter. Thirdly it maketh againſt him that made it. For firſt we denie the pope to be any chriſtians ſpirituall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For hée begetteth none by preaching, but deſtroieth infinite ſoules by maintaining falſe doctrine, and ruinateth chriſtendome by warres, murders and trecherous practiſes. We deny alſo, that <hi>Allen, Sanders</hi> or any ſuch trecherous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion hath any prerogatiue of birthright either in church, or common-wealth. Nay they haue declared themſelues to be traitors, and ſtrange children, enimies to their prince, &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. We ſay further, that no lawfull biſhop, much leſſe the pope, that is onely a biſhop in name and title, hath power to depriue a prince of his ſtate. We ſay finally, it is a malepert part for a childe, to determine that the father may put awaie his mother, and ſuch a one with a little helpe will declare his father a cruell huſband, his mother a diſhoneſt woman, and himſelfe a baſtardly ſonne.</p>
                     <p>Secondly it is ridiculous to compare the pope to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and princes to the good wife of the houſe, ſéeing theſe two
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:177777:66"/> do neuer kéepe houſe togither, and conſidering that the pope doth in his owne order vtterly condemne lawfull mariage. Againe what more fonde, then to compare the popes hoſtile procéedings, to iarres that fall out betwixt man and wife in a priuate houſe? Doth the goodman vpon euery iarre damne, and curſe his wife? Doth he ſeeke to cut her throte, as this good fellow doth the Quéenes? Laſtly how ridiculous is it to compare <hi>Allen, Sanders, Briſtow, Stapleton</hi> and ſuch like to children, when they haue declared themſelues old knaues ouergrowne in all trecherie and villanie, and run out of their natiue countrey? Do children runne from their mother, and forſake her houſe, to follow a reputed father, I knowe not where? Is not this the part of baſtardes, and not of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly if children ought with reuerence to reſpect their mother, then is this <hi>Allen</hi> a moſt vnnaturall ſonne, that hath with all villanous and reprochfull termes railed againſt his mother. Then are the rinegued prieſts, &amp; Ieſuites, and their conſorts murdring parricides, that by all meanes haue ſought the deſtruction of their mother, nay of the moſt kinde mother, that euer this people of England had. Againe if ſhée be as the good wife, and the pope as the good man; yet muſt not he take vpon him to be iudge in his owne cauſe. Nor ought any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be diſpoſſeſſed of her right, but by lawfull iudges, and orderly procéeding. It is a ſtrange kind of diuorce that is made by force of armes. But what eyther <hi>Parſons</hi> the Ieſuite talketh of the affection of parents, that neuer knew his right father; or baſtardly traytors talke of the right of princes, of which they are ignorant, it greatly ſkilleth not.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore ſeeing nothing is more apparent, then that Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> conſpired with the pope and Spaniardes to worke the deſtruction of his prince and countrey, and came with them <hi>anno</hi> 1588. ready with fire and ſworde to deſtroie this lande, and when hée coulde do no woorſe, barked out a multitude of helliſh ſlanders againſt the prince, the ſtate, and all goodmen; among all the traitors and enimies of this countrey he deſerueth to be in the firſt ranke. The ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt alſo we are to make of <hi>N. D.</hi> and all his conſorts, that allow his villanies, and treaſons. And thus much may ſuffice to anſwere our aduerſaries in wordes. The reſt I referre to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:177777:66"/> thoſe that carry the ſworde, which no doubt will prouide, as in ſuch time of danger the magiſtrates of Rome were woont, <hi>Ne quid reſp. detrimenti ab iſtis capiat.</hi>

Againe ſéeing they haue drawne into their ſynagogue many cuſtomes, whereof ſome are Iewiſh, other prophane and heatheniſh, they haue no wrong to bee charged with ſuperſtition. From the Iewes they draw their Leuiticall prieſthood, the formes of their ſacrifice, and all the furniture of the maſſe, their paſchall lambe, their Iubiley, and popedome. From the heathen they borrow their ſacrifices and praiers for the dead, their purgatorie &amp; the parts thereof, their ſtationarie obambulations about the limits of pariſhes, the canonizing and worſhip of ſaints departed, their holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and many ſuch like ceremonies. Laſtly they haue tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many points of old condemned hereſies into their cacolike religion. With the Simonians they buy and ſell freely, not onely benefices, and things annexed to ſpirituall things, but alſo ſacraments, not ſparing their holy God of the altar. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriores ſunt Iuda,</hi> ſaith Chriſt in Saint<note n="a" place="margin">Onus eccleſiae c. <hi>23.</hi>

                     <p>Firſt Chriſt Ieſus, that I may beginne with him, that is the beginning, and fountaine of all ſpirituall graces, and whom theſe Antijeſuites do ſeeme in ſome things to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait, and yet in moſt things oppugne, came from God, and did teach no doctrine, but which he had receiued from his father;

Chriſt Ieſus loued his owne and was beloued of his owne. Theſe vſurpers of the name of Ieſus loue none but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and were charged by their owne friends, and were accuſed of hereſie, ſchiſme, and many grieuous crimes, as witneſſeth <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badineira</hi> that wrote the legend of his father <hi>Ignatius.</hi> Our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Ieſus Chriſt, though Lord of heauen and earth, taught obedience to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and earthly princes: theſe fellowes albeit neither lordes, nor princes, yet teach diſobedience to princes, and diſſolue the bond of obedience, that tyeth ſubiectes to their ſuperiors. Chriſt Ieſus was the true ſhepheard, and ſought the ſaluation of his flocke; and albeit iniuriouſly apprehended and cruelly doone to death; yet like a lambe did he ſuffer, albeit he had power to execute vengeance vpon his perſecutors. But the Antijeſuites are like wolues in ſhéepes clothing, that prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe nothing more then murder of good men, and ſubuerſion of ſtates, and albeit no man touch them, or wrong them; yet are they vpon euery excommunication or commaundement of the pope ready to aſſaſſinate and murder princes, and whoſoeuer elſe ſhall ſtand in their way. Chriſt Ieſus was without ſinne, and a perfect patterne of righteouſneſſe, theſe Antijeſuites are ſlaues of their affections, and whereſoeuer they come, they<note n="a" place="margin">Hazenmiller, &amp; Simon Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus, &amp; Arnol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, &amp; Doleus in actione ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſ.

                     <p>Secondly the godly chriſtians of ancient time receiued no doctrine, but of Chriſt Ieſus, and his apoſtles: but theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian ſectaries haue all their rules from the pope of Rome, and his agents, and not from Chriſt nor his diſciples. Their doctrine, although it ſéemed new, yet was it indéed very ancient: but the rules of the Ieſuites are all confirmed within theſe thréeſcore yéeres, and all that filth and corruption of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, which they with their barking and bauling defende, is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:177777:74"/> but a packe of nouelties, or rather newe hereſies, inuented by diuers falſe apoſtles and teachers raiſed vp by ſathan, and commended by the authoritie of antichriſt the pope. The firſt chriſtian were men of peace, and eſtranged themſelues from princes courtes, and ſeldome medled with publike affaires; theſe ſectaries are like the frogs of Egypt, that leapt into all <hi>Pharohes</hi> chambers and cloſets. They inſinuate themſelues into princes courts, and enter into their ſecrets; they ſwarme euery where like lice; they ſtirre vp warres, and preach ſlaughter of true Chriſtians, whereſoeuer they come The apoſtles and firſt Chriſtians neuer taught rebellion, nor mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and empoiſonment of princes, nor ſlaughter of ſé<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But theſe apoſtles of ſatan preach ſedition and rebellion, and perſwade deſperate and loſt companions to murder, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſon innocent princes, and promiſe them for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe rewardes in earth, and eternall bleſſedneſſe in heauen. They murder ſuch as will not hearken to the popes lawes, and as <hi>Mahomet</hi> did in times paſt, ſo do theſe plant their ſect, with fire and ſword, and all manner of violence.</p>
                     <p>Finally all the godly both of ancient and late times by their godly life and fruites iſſuing of their Chriſtian faith ſhewed themſelues to be the true members of Chriſts church, and true Catholikes, and by their meekeneſſe, humilitie and patience wanne to themſelues a good name and opinion euen among their enimies. But the ruſtling and antichriſtian Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites through their impieties, hereſies, pride, couetouſneſſe, crueltie, filthie life and rebellious practiſes are ſuſpected of<note n="a" place="margin">Ribadineira, in vita Loiolae.</note> friends, abhorred of enimies, and generally hated of one and other, thoſe onely excepted, that either know them not, or know what gaine they get by their deſperate teaching and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures. There is no truth in their doctrine, no humilitie in their conuerſation, no honeſtie in their forced chaſtitie, no Chriſtian charitie or vertue among the companions of that ſect or ſocietie. And that ſhall well appéere by diuers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, notwithſtanding all the faire gloſſes of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſer.</p>
                     <p>Gladly woulde he perſwade his Reader, <hi>That thoſe that oppoſe themſelues againſt the Ieſuites are either Iewes, Turks,

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ults committed by the Noddy. Firſt manie things therein are confidently auouched without proofe, that are either very falſe, or very doubtfull. For firſt the Ieſuites haue good correſpondence with Iewes, Turkes, and Infidels, and neither do the Ieſuites perſecute the Iewes, that are maintained publikely at Rome; nor the Turkes or Infidels, that bende their forces to roote out Chriſtian religion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the name and memory of Chriſt and Chriſtians; nor do Turks and Iewes hurt the Ieſuites. Nay with the Iewes they haue good dealings deliuering the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their money to put out to intereſt. And ſo haue Iewes with the Ieſuites. When the Ieſuites of Rome made petition to <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> for ſome helpe, to finiſh that ſumptuous colledge, which they had begun for the vſe of their ſocietie: hée bad them content themſelues with the intereſt of their ſtockes of money, that were in the handes of banquers, and vſurers. Likewiſe the Ieſuites ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring the Turkes to enter into Tranſiluania, Hungaria, and frontiers of chriſtendome, do not onely not oppoſe themſelues againſt them, but alſo ſéeke to ſet Chriſtians at variance, and to murder and empoiſon princes, that ſhould withſtand them. Neither do the Iewes or Turkes maligne or ſpeake euill or hurt of Ieſuites. The Iewes trade with them. The Turkes ſuffer them quietly amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly he doth ridiculouſly and falſely ſuppoſe, that ſome among vs ſay, <hi>they are of Caluin;</hi> others, <hi>that they are of Luther.</hi> Hée ſhoulde do vs a pleaſure to ſhewe, who they bée. For wée neither holde of <hi>Caluin</hi> nor of <hi>Luther,</hi> no nor of pope <hi>Clement,</hi> nor any other, ſaue Chriſt Ieſus. If hée can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce the parties that are guiltie, wée muſt tell him that hee is a ridiculous accuſer, that obiecteth that to vs, wherein wée are cléere, and wherein hée and his conſorts are moſt guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and criminous. For the papiſts are diuided, and ſome hold of <hi>Ignatius Loiola,</hi> ſome of <hi>Francis,</hi> ſome of <hi>Dominicke,</hi> ſome of <hi>Brigit,</hi> ſome of <hi>Clare,</hi> and all of the pope: and ſuch holding &amp; pulling there is among them, that they haue pulled Chriſts
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:177777:75"/> cote a ſunder, and diuided themſelues from his church, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of antichriſt, and ſuch rules as they haue receiued from him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly hée doth but ſpeake his pleaſure, where hée ſaith, that <hi>Such eſpecially, as haue made ſhipwracke of faith, and ambitious and carnall worldlings do oppugne this ſect of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites.</hi> For they haue no better friendes, then the ambitious and luciferian popes, the carnall Cardinals, the fleſhly friers and prieſts, and popiſh atheiſts, that haue no God but the pope and their bellie; men in condition ſwiniſh and brutiſh, and in their religion helliſh. The firſt author of their ſect was a cruel, proud, and impious hypocrite. <hi>Paule</hi> the third, that firſt confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the rule and order of Ieſuites, was a carnall and bloodie man. His ſenſualitie appéered in the number of his whoores &amp; baſtardes. His crueltie in the perſecuting of innocent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in his warres in Germanie, and rebellious practiſes in England. Of later popes <hi>Gregorie</hi> the thirtéenth was their beſt friend, and gaue them diuers priuiledges, and built them an houſe. Yet was hée a carnall fellow, and a méere politicke. Hée kept certaine women, and his baſtardes in his time bore no ſmall ſwaie in Rome. One of them made loue to a mans wife of the houſe of <hi>Glorieri.</hi> Of whom receiuing ſome indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, he brought the <hi>Glorieri</hi> into hatred with his father. Who picking a quarrell to them fined <hi>Caeſar Glorieri,</hi> him that ſet his hand to the ſentence of excommunication againſt the Quéene, 100000. ducates, and another <hi>Glorieri,</hi> that was clarke of the popes checker chamber he put out of his office, and ſolde it for diuers thouſands of duckats. So you ſée much money made of a baudie matter, and you woulde woonder whether all this money went; and I beléeue hardly coulde you geſſe it. I will therefore aſſure you, that all this money went to the Ieſuites, and was moſt of it imploied in the building of their colledge at Rome. O holie ſocietie, and thriſe holy colledge erected for the moſt part by baudrie, and maintained as pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> ſaid, by vſurie! This may ſerue for a taſte to ſhew, that the beſt founders that Ieſuites haue, are carnall and ſenſuall men, that rather then they will frie in purgatorie, will giue the Ieſuites moſt of that they haue.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond fault of this enumeration is this, that it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue. For not ſo many atheiſtes, carnall worldlings, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:177777:75"/> as chriſtian and catholicke princes, zelous and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly biſhops and paſtors, and honeſt and religious Chriſtians do deteſt and abhor this wicked generation. Princes, for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard that they haue incurred of their liues and ſtates, haue eyther expulſed them and baniſhed them their countries, as the French king, the Tranſyluanian, and thoſe that profeſſe true religion; or had them in iealouſie, as the king of Poland, and diuers papiſticall princes. Godly Chriſtians haue reaſon to ſuſpect them, and deteſt them for their abominable doctrine, and treacherous, and murderous practiſes. Fathers feare them in regard of their children, whom they inueigle and ſteale away. The Venetians diſſolued a colledge in Padua, where gentlemens ſonnes were wont to be brought vp, for that the Ieſuites taking vpon them to teach there, corrupted their youth with their vnnaturall laſciuiouſnes: and reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them from teaching others, then ſuch as were of their own ſociety. Huſbandes haue them in iealouſie for their wiues, wiues for their husbands. For it is no rare matter for theſe ſubuerters of all humanity to draw wiues from husbandes, and husbandes from wiues, yea ſometimes through too much familiarity with women, they ſpoile the men. A certaine <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifico</hi> in Venice perceiuing his wiues iewels to be wanting, in the end learned that the Ieſuites had gotten them. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point, I thinke the Ieſuites will not deny, but that the Carmelites, and Franciſcanes, and Dominicans, and othe orders of fryers are as honeſt men, as themſelues; yet all theſe do inwardly hate them. At Vienna they thruſt out the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> at Mentz the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> at Trier and Branſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg the <hi>Franciſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> out of their houſes; which maketh theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to hate them. In Bauier the prieſts béeing brought to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty and ſhame by the Ieſuites, haue no reaſon to loue them. And thus we ſée that many honeſt men do eyther ſuſpect or hate the Ieſuites; and ſome alſo which they themſelues cannot take iuſt exception againſt.</p>
                     <p>Let vs therefore now conſider, whether the cauſes, that haue mooued and occaſioned this hatred againſt the Ieſuites, be iuſt or no. The diſcourſer ſaith, <hi>They are had in hatred, and emulation eyther for their rule and profeſſion, or for their learning and doctrine, or for their life and conuerſation.</hi> But firſt the parts of this diuiſion are imperfect; next the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:177777:76"/> diuers vntruthes, and more are added in the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Laſtly the whole defence parted in this diuiſion is not ſufficient to iuſtifie the courſe and actions of the Ieſuites, the imperfection may be prooued by diuers particulars. For they are not onely hated for theſe thrée cauſes, but for diuers others. As namely for that they do many things both contrary to their owne rule, and contrary to the rule of Gods law, and Chriſtian religion. They profeſſe obedience, but they practiſe ſedition and rebellion. <hi>Claudius Matthew</hi> a Ieſuite and king <hi>Henry</hi> the third of France his confeſſor, was the moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall author and agent in the league of papiſts againſt him, and the peace eſtabliſhed a litle before. <hi>Parſons</hi> and <hi>Campian</hi> were ſent into England to make a faction for the papiſtes. which appeared in this, that they procured a faculty to ſuſpend the bull of <hi>Pius,</hi> as farre as it concerned papiſts no further then, <hi>Rebus ſic ſtantibus.</hi> Theſe fellowes are the principall agents and ſtirrers of the rebellion in Ireland. <hi>Iames Gordon, Creichton,</hi> and <hi>Hayes</hi> Ieſuites laide a plot not onely for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in Scotland, but for an inuaſion in England. Neither hath any warre or tumult béene rayſed of late in any part of Chriſtendome, wherein the Ieſuites haue not borne a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall part. They profeſſe chaſtitie, and the law of God forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all vncleannes. but how theſe obſerue this profeſſion and law, I report me to their owne conſciences, to the Ieſuites of Rome and Padua, and to their practiſe in allowing, and now and then frequenting bordelles. They talke much of volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pouerty, and Chriſt ſaith, all ſhould be left for his ſake. But theſe good fellowes leaue Chriſt for the wealth and eaſe they find in the order of Ieſuites. They dwell in coſtly pallaces, their dyet &amp; apparrell is more dainty and braue then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The furniture of their houſes and churches is gorgious and princely. Their armes are placed aboue the armes of princes. moſt couetouſly they ſcratch and ſcrape from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, widow and poore, and put out their mony to intereſt their rule and outward profeſſion is to gaine ſoules; but their practiſe is to kill ſoules. They promiſe to teach without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but if a great man will giue them a million, they take all. Nay they pretend to begge for baniſhed Engliſh, but take moſt themſelues, and by all practiſes ſéeke to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by bribes and rewardes. They profeſſe religion, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:177777:76"/> the name of Ieſus, but they are the ſlaues of the pope, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the faith of Ieſus, preferring the decretals before ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in certainty, and make a ſcoffe at religion. In Venice they painted the virgine <hi>Mary</hi> like a Lady in the city, whome they loued: &amp; as<note n="a" place="margin">Vita Pij Quinti.</note> 
                        <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> caſt an <hi>Agnus dei</hi> into the riuer, ſo theſe vſe the ſame practiſe in their coniurations. Nay they adminiſter the ſacrament to thoſe, that go about to murder princes, as <hi>Walpoole</hi> did to <hi>Squire.</hi> Firſt then they are hated for dooing againſt Gods law, and their owne written rules. Secondly for their ignorance in true religion. Thirdly for that they peruert others by their leud perſwaſions, and euill example. Fourthly, for that they peruert youth and teach them euill manners. Fiftly for that they are not aſhamed to defend any old condemned hereſie, or groſſe new error holden by the pope. Laſtly for that they peruert ſcriptures, and corrupt the fathers and other auncient writers, both adding and taking away, and altering the text. Which power <hi>Gregory</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téenth in a bull bearing date Anno 1575. ſéemeth to haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto them.</p>
                     <p>That this diuiſion containeth diuers vntruthes, it will appeare by theſe arguments. Where he ſaith, <hi>They are hated for their rule, which notwithſtanding is the ſame in ſubſtance with other religions, and a way to perfection,</hi> there are thrée apparent vntruthes. Firſt true Chriſtians rather abhorre them for their vnruli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es, then for their rule; and other ſectes albeit they loue their rule, yet hate the men for their leud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; and their friendes in regard of their rule that agréeth ſo well with the popes humor, do loue them. Secondly this rule is diuers from Chriſtes rule, which is the onely true and direct rule of religion. It varieth alſo in infinite pointes from the rules both of monkes, and begging friers. Neither canne this be denyed. For if it were the ſame, yea euen in ſubſtance, what ſhould we néede this new rule, hauing Chriſtes rule? Beſide, what meane the Ieſuites to adde a fourth vowe and ſo many ſtrange conſtitutions and lawes? If the profeſſion of Ieſuites be the ſame, that the ancient eremites or monkes profeſſed, why do they tie themſelues with ſuch othes, and practiſe in matters of ſtate, and thruſt themſelues into the preaſe of people, which the firſt monkes did not? Thirdly it is moſt abſurd to affirme or thinke, that <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> could
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:177777:77"/> deuiſe a more perfect rule, then Chriſt Ieſus; or that Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed not a perfect rule, but that we ſhould néede <hi>Ignatius</hi> a lame ſoldiers, and blind guides helpe. The Ieſuites therefore are hated not ſo much for their rule, as for other iuſt cauſes. And no more doth the commendation of ancient monkes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them, then the praſes of the ancient people of Iſraell to the obſtinate Iewes that crucified Chriſt, or of the old Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes, to the ſcumme of the world, that doth now inhabite Rome.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo moſt vntrue, that they are hated for their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. for not their learning, but the abuſe of their learning which is wholy employed to maintaine hereſies, doth make honeſt men to ſuſpect them, and abhorre them. Would they teach the catholicke faith as this man pretendeth they do, they ſhould be beloued, and embraced. But he muſt know, that their doctrine of the popes power and ſupremacy, of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Romiſh church, of purgatorie and infinite other points is not catholike. Much therefore is hée deceiued that thinketh wée account the name of a Ieſuite to bée a crime. for both maſter <hi>Topcliffe</hi> whom hée bringeth in to witneſſe this point, and many others can tell, that their treaſons, prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, and lewdneſſe haue made them odious, and not the name of Ieſuites onely.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly the defence of this diſcourſer is very vnſufficient. For it is not inough to ſay that they haue a rule, and learning, and liue orderly, but they muſt haue their office and calling al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Chriſt Ieſus, if they meane to take vpon them the office of paſtors, teachers, and gouernors in Chriſtes church. Wherefore eyther let them ſhew themſelues to haue a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling, or let them not thinke much, to be thruſt out, as intruders.

Nay we do not read, that Chriſt commaunded any to forſweare mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, or to giue away their goods to idle vagabondes, or to obey the rules of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> but rather the contrarie.</p>
                     <p>Further it is not ſufficient in termes to praiſe the doctrine and manners of Ieſuites, vnleſſe this diſcourſer were able to iuſtifie the ſame by the rule of Chriſtes doctrine, and example
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:177777:77"/> of Chriſt and his apoſtles, and the holy fathers of the church. But that will be very hard for him to do. Chriſt neuer taught, that princes were to bee depoſed by the apoſtles or their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, or that it was lawfull to kill excommunicate perſons. Theſe teach, that it is lawfull for the pope to depoſe princes, and that it is lawfull for the ſubiects to rebell againſt ſuch, as the pope ſhall excommunicate, and to kill them. <hi>Benedict Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio,</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Parries vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> and <hi>Annibal Codret</hi> two famous Ieſuites did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teach <hi>William Parry,</hi> that it was lawfull to kill the Quéene of England, but alſo that it was an act very meritorious, <hi>Varade</hi> a Ieſuite of Lion in confeſſion did abſolue <hi>Peter Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere,</hi> that went about to murder the French king now reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and did aſſure him, that it was a moſt noble and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian act, for which he ſhoulde obteine celeſtiall glorie, as the ſaide <hi>Peter</hi> being executed at Melun for the ſaide attempt, confeſſed: who likewiſe affirmed, that another Ieſuite whoſe name he knew not, did concurre with <hi>Varade</hi> in the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. In Paris the Ieſuites not onely reſolued, that it was lawfull to kill king <hi>Henry</hi> the third, but alſo by their perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions did induce <hi>Iames Clement</hi> to effect the ſame. <hi>Richard Williams, Edmund Yorke, Patricke Ocollen, Iohn Sauage,</hi> and diuers others, that haue béene at ſeuerall times executed for attempting to kill the Queene confeſſed, that they were perſwaded to it by <hi>Holt,</hi> and other Ieſuites; and were alſo made beléeue, that it was a moſt meritorious act. Lately one <hi>Edmund Squire</hi> confeſſed, that hée was induced to empoiſon the Quéene by <hi>Walpoole</hi> an Engliſh Ieſuite in Spaine. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Panne</hi> confeſſed before his execution at <hi>Leiden,</hi> that hée was hired to kill the Count <hi>Morice</hi> the terror of the papiſts, and a great protector of the oppreſſed in the Low countries. Neither is it to bee doubted, but that this is the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and iudgement of all Ieſuites. For if it be lawfull for ſubiects to rebell againſt their princes vpon the popes war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and commandement, as they holde; then is it alſo law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to kill them, and murder them. For armes are not taken vp for other end, then to force, and kill all that reſiſt. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is not likely, that ſo many woulde concurre in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, if they did not like it. Thirdly they woulde not teach it openly, as did <hi>Comolet</hi> in the laſt ſiege of Paris, ſaying <hi>That there wanted an Ahud,</hi> meaning there wanted one to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:177777:78"/> kill the king. Fourthly they woulde not otherwiſe in their colledges diſpute &amp; reſolue, that it was lawfull to kill princes exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate by the pope. And this is prooued firſt by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of one <hi>Chaſtel</hi> a ſcholler of the Ieſuites, that wounded <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. of France, &amp; purpoſed to haue killed him. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> writings of one <hi>Ghineard</hi> a Ieſuit of the colledge of Clermont in Paris.<note n="a" place="margin">In the regiſter of the court of Parliam. of Paris.</note> 
                        <hi>Chaſtell</hi> being demanded <hi>Whether this queſtion, viz.</hi> whether it was not lawfull to kill the king, <hi>was not ordinarily talked of and diſputed among Ieſuites; anſwered, that hee hath oftentimes heard them ſay, that it was lawfull to kill the king, for that hee was out of the Romiſh church, and that it was not lawfull to obey him, nor holde him for king, vntill he ſhoulde be approoued by the pope.</hi> Hée affirmed the ſame likewiſe in his ſecond examination: and for that wicked attempt was executed. <hi>Ghineard</hi> did not onelie allow and praiſe the execrable murder committed by <hi>Iames Clement</hi> a Dominican frier vpon <hi>Henry</hi> the third, but alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed <hi>That Henry the fourth if hee were not killed in the warres muſt bee killed otherwiſe,</hi> and in diuers bookes and papers written by him, prooued, <hi>That it was lawfull to kill kings,</hi> declared by the Pope to bée out of the church. Finallie for this wicked doctrine the Ieſuites were<note n="b" place="margin">In the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment erected in Paris.</note> baniſhed France, <hi>As a pernitious ſect teaching, that it was lawfull for any to kill kings,</hi> and as it is conteined in the arreſt againſt them, <hi>As perturbers of peace, and enimies of kings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſt neuer taught ſubiectes to breake their faith giuen to their princes, nor to riſe in armes againſt them. nay the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, albeit they neither<note n="c" place="margin">Tertullian apologet. &amp; ad Scapulam.</note> wanted meanes, nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity; yet did they neuer go about to take away the crowne from eyther infidels, or apoſtataes, or heretickes, but rather obeyed them, and prayed for them. But Ieſuites they hould, that it is lawfull for ſubiectes to take armes, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againſt their princes, and teach, that the pope hath power to looſe them from the bond of their allegiance. This doctrine <hi>Parſons</hi> and <hi>Campian</hi> meant to haue practiſed in England. And <hi>Claudius Matthew</hi> anno 1585, did practiſe in France, being a principall worker of that rebellion, that was made againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the third. The rebelles of Paris that held out againſt their kings, were principally directed and comforted by <hi>Comolet</hi> and other Ieſuites. Nay when mony &amp; victuals
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:177777:78"/> grewe ſcarce in Paris; yet woulde not the Ieſuites ſuffer the rebelles to giue ouer, but rather came into the trenches, and brought with them of their owne ſtore to giue to the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. By the practiſes of this ſeditious ſect the cities of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigueux, Agen, Tholoſe, Verdun, and diuers others tooke armes againſt the king.</p>
                     <p>In Scotland all late ſtirres haue béene rayſed by the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of <hi>Crichton, Gourdon,</hi> and <hi>Haies</hi> Ieſuites. Neyther is any thing doone in the rebellion of Ireland, but by their direction and counſell.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt neuer taught children to ſhew themſelues vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and vnkinde to their parents; or women froward and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious to their huſbandes. But theſe ſteale children from the parentes, and conuey them, where they are neuer more heard of, as is apparent by the example of <hi>Airault</hi> of <hi>Angiers</hi> his ſonne and infinite others. In Friburg they perſwaded the women to deale with their huſbandes, to entertaine a practiſe againſt the cantous of contrary religion; and when they could not otherwiſe obtaine it, by the counſell of Ieſuites, they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to lye with their huſbandes.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Chriſtians were examples of méekeneſſe, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, liberality to the poore, of gentleneſſe and clemency, and all virtue. Theſe counterfeit Chriſtians, that call themſelues Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, are proud hauty, diſdainfull, couetous, cruell, vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. While they perſwaded the Duke of Bauier to go on foote to viſite the reliques of ſome ſaint, theſe gallantes road in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons. The princeſſe of Tyrole built the Ieſuites a houſe hard by hers; but it was not long before they had gotten into the princes palace, and thruſt her into their owne meane houſe. Likewiſe did they exclude the biſhop of Herbipolis out of a church, which himſelfe had built for them. They encroch not onely vpon the liuinges of ſecular prieſtes, and take away their tithes and prebendes, but alſo vpon all other regular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. They aduance themſelues and deſpiſe others. thoſe that confeſſe themſelues to other prieſtes, they accompt litle better then Atheiſtes. In Milan they onely beare the ſway in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring womens confeſſions, and did the like at Venice, vntill they were forbidden.</p>

                     <p>So cruell they are, that they ſpare none, that is repugnant to their purpoſes. <hi>Maffaeus</hi> complained that the elder Ieſuites managed all matters abſolutely: but hée was ſent for his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour into Portugall. They brought <hi>Harbort,</hi> and <hi>Gliſel</hi> two famous preachers in Vienna in danger, onely enuying their excellencie.

Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Borrhomeus</hi> reſtreining their encrochments was by them accuſed before the pope.</p>
                     <p>Of their forced chaſtitie what fruites inſue, I referre me to the report of <hi>Hazenmyller,</hi> and others that haue liued amongſt them.

And if they had béene ſo chaſte as they pretend, the Venetians woulde not haue diſſolued the colledge of yoong gentlemen in Padua, where theſe fellowes were teachers and regents, for auoiding of publike ſcandale.</p>
                     <p>Neither hath the Noddy our aduerſary either iuſt excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to auoide this accuſation, or witte to cleare his Clients. <hi>Gretzerus</hi> hath long trauailed to purge his companions of this ſlaunder, but all in vaine. And therefore ſmall reaſon hath this petit companion to attempt that, wherein his betters haue failed. But ſéeing he hath gone about to face out matters, let vs conſider of his allegation. In defence of the Ieſuites of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:177777:80"/> Paris charged with the allowance of the act of <hi>Iohn Chaſtel</hi> that attempted to murder king <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, he ſaith, <hi>That the ſaid Iohn Chaſtell examined vpon the torture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly denied, that any Ieſuite liuing was priuy to his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of killing the king, or had giuen him therein counſell, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, or inſtruction; and that his father beeing examined did likewiſe deny it.</hi> But the recordes of his examination which are yet to be ſéene do affirme flat contrary, as before I haue ſhewed. And the ſentence of the court of parliament of Paris doth plainely porport, that this fact was attempted by the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites counſell and inſtruction; and therefore was it ordered, <hi>That they ſhould depart out of Paris within three dayes, and out of France within fifteene dayes after notice to them giuen, as corrupters of youth, perturbers of publike peace, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the king &amp; the ſtate. Iohn Chaſtel</hi> alſo himſelfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed, <hi>That Garet a Ieſuite did teach him theſe leſſons, which made him reſolue to kill the king.</hi> Yea and that the father and ſiſters of the young man with teares and bitter tearmes deteſting the Ieſuites did declare further that it might appeare to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, that this was the doctrine of Ieſuites, that they taught the ſaide <hi>Chaſtell,</hi> a pillar was ſet vp in the place, where this deſperate murderer and parricide dwelt, teſtifying the ſame, and mentioning that this was the cauſe of their expulſion out of France. In that Monument the Ieſuites are called <hi>Mali magiſtri,</hi> and their colledge <hi>Schola impia,</hi> and their religion called <hi>Noua &amp; malefica ſuperſtitio.</hi> Further the Ieſuites in a certaine apologie publiſhed preſently vpon their expulſion out of France, do not denie <hi>Iohn Chaſtels</hi> attempt to be lawfull or contrary to canons, but rather conformable vnto them; and that they endeuour to prooue by <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> his bul againſt the king, and refute the ſentence of the court againſt the ſaide <hi>Chaſtel,</hi> as vniuſt.</p>
                     <p>He procéedeth further in cléering the Ieſuites &amp; ſaith, <hi>That Iohn Garet Chaſtels maſter being tortured denied, that the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites were priuie to this fact, and that thereupon by publike teſtimony of the magiſtrate he was declared innocent.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he declareth himſelfe very impudent, howſoeuer the other was declared innocent. for I haue ſhewed before by diuers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that the Ieſuites were both priuie to this fact, and did publikely defend the doctrine. Nay the<note n="a" place="margin">Of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Paris.</note> regiſter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:177777:81"/> his confeſſion is recorded, and the ſentence of the court doth declare, that the ſaid <hi>Garet</hi> being a Ieſuite was the teacher of that wicked doctrine, which <hi>Chaſtell</hi> ment to execute, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by publike ſentence <hi>Was hee baniſhed France, and his goods confiſcated.</hi> Let it then bée conſidered, with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience this woorthy Warder affirmeth, that <hi>Garet was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared innocent by the magiſtrate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hée ſaith alſo, <hi>That Iohn Ghineard Ieſuite was put to death for that in his ſtudie this queſtion, Whether it be lawfull in any caſe to kill a tyrant, was found diſputed on both ſides without reſolution.</hi> But the<note n="a" place="margin">In the proceſſe againſt Ghi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neard.</note> regiſter of the court of parliament of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris doth conuince his impudent lying. For there it is teſtified, that <hi>The ſaide Ghineard was founde ſeazed of diuers bookes compoſed by him, and written with his owne hand conteining the approbation of the inhumane murder of Henry the third.</hi> Beſide that the court of Parliament of Paris enioined him to confeſſe, <hi>That hee had wickedly ſpoken, and determined, that if Henry the fourth was not ſlaine in the wars, hee muſt be ſlaine otherwiſe.</hi> Finally his owne hande writing, which hée acknowledged vpon his examination doth ſhewe, that he did not onely propound the queſtion in <hi>Theſi,</hi> but reſolued it in <hi>Hypotheſi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither doth our aduerſarie doubt to accuſe the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Paris of great iniuſtice for executing the ſaide <hi>Ghi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neard, Seeing he ſaide no more, then Thomas, Caietan, Sotus, and other ſcholaſticall diuines, and Philoſophers in times paſt.</hi> As if ſcholaſticall diuinitie, and Philoſophers fancies were warrant ſufficient for men to kill princes, or for Chriſtians to attempt any thing. Beſide that, the caſe of the Ieſuites, and of ancient writers is diuers. Theſe onely thinke it lawfull to kill ſuch tyrants, as by oppreſſion and force inuade a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. The Ieſuites account all tyrants, that reſiſt the popes tyrannie, and are by him excommunicate. Olde writers, for the moſt part, ſpeake in <hi>Theſi</hi> againſt vſurpers. But <hi>Ghine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> the Ieſuite ſpoke in <hi>Hypotheſi,</hi> and determined,<note n="b" place="margin">In papers of Ghineard.</note> 
                        <hi>That it was lawfull to kill Henry the</hi> 3. and <hi>Henry the</hi> 4. which all the world acknowledgeth to be lawfull kings, the popiſh faction onely excepted. The fact of <hi>Iames Clement,</hi> that murdred <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the third, this <hi>Ghineard</hi> calleth <hi>Heroicall, and a gift of gods ſpirit.</hi> Speaking of king <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth he ſaith thus, <hi>If he
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:177777:81"/> die not in the warres, let him be ſlaine ſome otherwaies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hauing done with the Ieſuites of France, he goeth about to anſwere for the Ieſuites of Doway and the low countries, that, as <hi>Peter Panne</hi> confeſſed himſelfe, <hi>Perſwaded and hired, and furniſhed him with a knife to kill Count Morice.</hi> And this action he calleth a fiction, denying that euer the Ieſuites had any ſuch intention. But the matter is all too plaine to be faced out with flearing wordes. The poore man was taken ſeaſed with a ſtrange faſhioned knife. béeing examined he voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſed both his owne fault, and by whome he was indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to do that wicked act. He continued in his confeſſion, and was executed for his treaſon at Leyden. The magiſtrates of Leyden do teſtifie ſo much, and there is no cauſe, why any part of this narration ſhould ſéeme vntrue. For no man hath reaſon to accuſe himſelfe, or others vniuſtly, eſpecially where it goeth vpon the perill of a mans life. Nor is it likely, that any ſhould ſuffer death for matter feined, and ſuppoſed, and without proofe. Certes, if any doubted of the matter before,<note n="b" place="margin">Sica tragica.</note> 
                        <hi>Coſters</hi> and this Noddies defence is ſo ſimple, that it may greatly confirme him in this truth. They alledge certificates to diſprooue <hi>Peter Pannes</hi> confeſſion. But what credite can ſuch writinges deſerue, that may bée forged, for any thing wée knowe, and béeing admitted to haue béene written, yet appeare to haue beene extorted by the Ieſuites, and made by men fauouring their faction? Beſide that they ſéeme to bee graunted without due proofe, and procéeding, and yet neither conclude againſt <hi>Peter Panne,</hi> nor his confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Firſt it is alleaged, <hi>That hee was no papiſt at all.</hi> But that is a fiction without all colour. For why ſhould not he be reputed a papiſte, that was continually among them, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had taſt of any other religion? Secondly our aduerſarie ſaith, <hi>He was a drunken, vagrant and madde fellow.</hi> As if he were not therefore more likely to enterpriſe ſuch a made action. He telleth vs further, <hi>That Peter Panne was a man extreame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well affected to Count Morice.</hi> But how canne this be proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſeeing it appeareth by the proceſſe made againſt him, that he neither knew him, nor euer had ſéene him before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into Holland? Is it not extreame folly to imagine any ſuch extremity of affection without cauſe or proofe? Fourthly he would beare vs in hand, <hi>That the Ieſuites had no cauſe to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:177777:82"/> deſire Count Morice his death.</hi> Why then did the Ieſuites ſéeke his fathers death, and perſwade men to kill the Quéene of England, and the French king? Do not men of euery facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deſire thoſe taken out of the way, that are oppoſite to their deſignes? Fiftly he denieth, that <hi>Peter Panne euer prouided butter for the colledge of Ieſuites,</hi> as is conteined in <hi>Peter Pannes</hi> confeſſion. But what reaſon had hée to confeſſe it, if the matter were not true? Theſe fellowes haue reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie it for their owne credite. Hée denieth alſo, <hi>That the Ieſuites had any ſeruant called Melchior du Val.</hi> But that is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, ſéeing there are fewe Ieſuites, but they haue two or thrée names, and it may bée, that this <hi>Melchior</hi> alſo going about ſo wicked a purpoſe, changed his name. Further hée ſaith, <hi>That there was neuer any ſpeech had with Peter Pannes wife in Ipres about this matter, and denieth that euer ſhee had any acquaintance with any Ieſuite.</hi> But hée muſt bée very well acquainted with her, that knew both what ſhée did, and what ſhée ſaide, and what not. This Noddy, if hée had béene wiſe, woulde haue alleaged ſome reaſon of his ſaying. His compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion<note n="a" place="margin">Sica tragica.</note> 
                        <hi>Coſterus</hi> for proofe alleageth her examination. But how ſhoulde wée beleeue, that euer ſhee was duely examined, or that ſhée ſaide, as is alleaged? Againe if béeing induced by Ieſuites, ſhée ſhoulde ſpeake any ſuch thing: yet who woulde not rather beléeue her huſband vttring matter againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, then ſuch a light huſwife ſpeaking vntruth without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or controlement, and percaſe béeing hired? Laſtly whereas <hi>Peter Panne</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed, <hi>That in the rogation weeke next before, he talked with the prouinciall, &amp; others of the colledge of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites at Doway;</hi> and told, that they promiſed him reward in earth &amp; bliſſe in heauen for executing that act; this diſcourſer telleth vs, <hi>That the Prouinciall that weeke was</hi> 60. <hi>miles from Doway, and that there paſſed no ſuch conference with Peter Panne.</hi> And this hée ſaith <hi>Is prooued by witneſſes, and certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by cacolike magiſtrates.</hi> But hée ſhoulde haue vnderſtood, that witneſſes examined in the abſence of parties, and percaſe neither ſworne, nor duely examined, prooue nothing. Beſide that, wée haue good cauſe to except againſt ſuch iudges, and ſuch witneſſes, as our profeſſed enimies do chooſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. But ſuppoſe all their relation were true; yet ſuch certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates prooue nothing, but that <hi>Peter Panne</hi> either miſtooke
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:177777:82"/> the names, or qualities of ſome perſons named in his exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: and it may be, that the Ieſuites made him beléeue, he was brought to the prouinciall and chéefe of the colledge, when hée was onely before ſome other baſe companion of that ſocietie.

Among them certes there were no aſſaſſinors, and murderers of kings, nor practiſers againſt princes ſtates; nor ſuch proude and cruell ſectaries, as are the Ieſuites. And albeit Ieſuites eate no children, which crime was imputed to ancient Chriſtians, yet they haue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the death of millions of men, women, and children, that in the ſtirres and tumults raiſed by them, haue periſhed: and daily more and more matter we finde againſt them.</p>

                     <p>This diſcourſer telleth vs, <hi>That the chaſtitie of Ieſuites muſt imitate the puritie of angels.</hi> But vnleſſe by angels hée vnderſtand wicked angels and diuels, the Ieſuites will come farre ſhort of their example, which they propoſe to themſelues to imitate. The angels of God certes neither burne in luſt, nor abandon themſelues to the delites of the worlde.

After this hée runneth into a large diſcourſe of the martyrdomes, and voluntarie ſuffringes of the Ieſuites in the Indies, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing percaſe, if any entend to trace him in his lying, to make him trauell a great iorney. But ſuppoſe they ſhoulde ſuffer death &amp; tortures, yet that is a matter common to them, and to rebels, traitors, malefactors; yea to ſuch as fall into the hand of barbarous people, that reſpect not whom they maſſacre. <hi>Ghineard</hi> in France, and <hi>Campian</hi> and other Ieſuites in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:177777:83"/> England haue ſuffred, but<note n="a" place="margin">See the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the <hi>4.</hi> encounters en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing.</note> not for the teſtimonie of truth. Euill therfore are thoſe words of <hi>Iuſtine apolog.</hi> 1. concerning the patient ſuffering of Chriſtians applied to Ieſuites, that are neither martyrs, nor good Chriſtians, nor ſuffer for other cauſe, but their offences; and that moſt vnwillingly, and vnpatiently, as by <hi>Campian</hi> and by diuers examples may bée prooued. The compariſon likewiſe betwixt the firſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that were charged to be <hi>Sylueſtres</hi> and <hi>Syluicolae,</hi> and the Ieſuites, is moſt improper. For Ieſuites neither liue in woodes, nor holes, as did the firſt Chriſtians, but in princely pallaces, and kinges courts, and in the preſſe of people. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they retired for meditation, but runne diſguiſed ouer the worlde, and thruſt themſelues into all companies, to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe them wicked treaſons, and to execute their holie fathers deſſeignements.</p>
                     <p>Hee braggeth very much of the Ieſuites teaching and of their reading artes, toongs, and ſciences. As if artes, toongs, and ſciences were not as well taught before the name of this ſect was heard of, and ſhall not bee ſo againe, when the whole order of them ſhall be extinguiſhed. As for their teaching, it ſhould bée much more commendable, if with truth and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they did not mingle falſhoode, hereſie, and poiſon; and their toongs were more to bée eſtéemed, if they did not teach them to ſpread lies and ſlanders. But whatſoeuer their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is, they enter vpon the paſtors office, and intrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into it without commiſſion and authoritie. Nay they enter by other waies then the dore, and in the folde make ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocke of Chriſtes lambes.</p>
                     <p>Hée compareth them alſo to ſaint<note n="b" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</note>

Nay in the end hée doubteth not to iuſtifie the turbulent procéedings of the Ieſuites, by the example of Chriſt Ieſus, who was charged with troubling the people, and forbidding to pay tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as hée ſaith. but the difference and oddes is ſo great, as may make a man woonder, why hée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared things ſo vnlike togither. The apoſtles were makers of peace, moſt humble and méeke men, true diſciples of Chriſt, and moſt painfull laborers in planting true religion, &amp; draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to Chriſt. But theſe falſe apoſtles are ſowers of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, trumpets of warre, proud braggers and boaſters of their
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:177777:84"/> angelicall holineſſe painfull labours, and profound learning; conterfect Chriſtians and true diſciples of Satan. Painefull labourers, but to ouerthrow rather then to build; to drawe men to antichriſt, and not to Chriſt; not ſéeking to win ſoules by teaching the meanes of ſaluation, but to deſtroy ſoules by teaching falſe doctrine, vaine traditions, and by bringing men into the thraldome of antichriſt. Chriſt and his apoſtles were accuſed moſt vniuſtly. Theſe moſt iuſtly, as hath béene veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Chriſt made a diuiſion in the world, making good of bad, and ſeparating the good from the bad. But the Ieſuites make of good, bad; and ſet diuiſion where there was peace before, as appéereth by their whole procéeding. Yea and our aduerſarie confeſſeth, that of colde cacolikes, they make hot recuſants. Therefore may they bée iuſtly called <hi>Rerump. incendiarij,</hi> that is burners of common-wealthes, and fire-brands of Satan, that of good ſubiects by their reconcilements make ſeditious leaguers, deſperate murtherers, buſie practiſers and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbers of ſtates.</p>

Finally we muſt not thinke, that the Ieſuites haue had eyther other purpoſe, or deſire this many yéeres, then to ſtirre vp ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and warres againſt her, and to bring the realme vnder the pope and Spanyard, whome they ſerue; which cannot be done without the deſtruction of her perſon, and the deſolation
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:177777:84"/> of this realme.</p>
                     <p>Neither may we thinke, that <hi>Parſons</hi> the Ieſuite, albeit for ſome purpoſe, percaſe, he hath kept himſelfe from open ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of treaſons, is better diſpoſed towardes her Maieſtie, and the ſtate, then the reſt of his companions. For all Ieſuites allow the popes power in depoſing princes, which cannot be without their deſtruction. Yea and <hi>Parſons</hi> himſelfe hath not dealt ſo cloſely, but that there are many great and euident proofes of his diſloyalty and trechery. For not onely the booke ſet out vnder the name of <hi>Dolman</hi> concerning the ſucceſſion to the crowne of England is his; but alſo diuers other<note n="a" place="margin">Andreas Philopater: Leyceſters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, a confutation of cauſes. &amp;c.</note> treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable bookes and pamphlets, whereby he goeth about, not onely to ſtirre vp troubles in England, but alſo to conuey the title of the crowne to the infant of Spaine, and to bring in ſtrangers: for which he is reprooued by a certaine popiſh prieſt not altogether ſo leud as himſelfe in a<note n="b" place="margin">Pag. <hi>12.</hi> &amp; paſſim.</note> treatiſe printed at Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len anno 1600. and intituled, <hi>A diſcouery of a counterfait con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, &amp;c.

Secondly in this treatiſe, which is either <hi>Parſons</hi> his deuiſe, or at leaſt allowed by <hi>Parſons,</hi> not onely the cauſe of rebels and traitors, that haue ſought to deſtroy her Maieſtie, is pleaded, but alſo the fact of <hi>Ghineard</hi> the Ieſuite, that expreſty<note n="c" place="margin">His notes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtre of the court of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Paris, and in the ſixt recueil of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the league.</note> determined, <hi>That Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the third of France was iuſtly ſlaine, and that tyrants</hi> (in which degrée hée putteth all princes excommunicate by the pope) <hi>may lawfully by any be ſlaine.</hi> Thirdly he is a factor for the pope and Spaniard nowe profeſſed enimies of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and this kingdome. And all the worlde knoweth, that they haue nothing more in their vowes, then her Maieſties ruine. Fourthly hée is a Ieſuite, whoſe oath and profeſſion is to do whatſoeuer his ſuperior commandeth. If then the pope commaund, as no doubt, but hée hath and will, there is no queſtion, but he muſt alſo come togither with his conſorts, &amp; with fire &amp; ſword oppugne this lande, and deſtroy the prince. Fiftly it is ridiculous to diſpute of his intention, when wée may ſée his hoſtile &amp; traytorous minde by his actions. He hath
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:177777:85"/> abandoned his prince and country, he adhereth to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties profeſſed enemies. In times paſt he and <hi>Campian</hi> came into this country with inſtructions and authority from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like enemies, with a reſolution to ſée the popes pleaſure execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to make a ſide for his holy father. Let him deny any part of this, if he canne. Nay let him but anſwere firſt whether he brought not a faculty from the pope giuing leaue to papiſts to obey her Maieſtie, ſo long as the ſtate ſtood in tearmes, as then it did: and vntill the popes bull could be executed: and next, whether the popes ſentence béeing declared and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, he and all papiſtes were not purpoſed, and bound to do their worſt againſt her. Sixtly, he was among the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yardes, that in the yéere 1588, came in hoſtile aray to cut her Maieſties throte, and to deſtroy her people, if they had could. Laſtly he alloweth the dooings of Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> that the ſame time ſtirred vp all papiſtes to lay hands on her Maieſty, and perſwaded them to take armes againſt her, and to aſſiſt the Spaniards. Hée alſo knew a certaine Engliſhman, that came into England, with full reſolution to murder her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, and neuer reuealed ſo much. If then hée take the Queene for his mother, and the mother of her countrey, as this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſer ſignifieth, then muſt <hi>Parſons</hi> confeſſe, that he is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide, that ſéeketh to lay violent handes vpon his mother. And if hée call this an odious and heinous crime; as indeed it is; then is hée guiltie of a moſt odious crime, and is a moſt odious rebell. This being his charge, let vs ſée his defence. <hi>Let the examinations</hi> ſaith hée, <hi>of Parry, Sauage, and ſuch others be viewed ouer, and ſee whether any of them do accuſe father Parſons.</hi> As if none were guiltie of theſe treaſons, but ſuch as were named by their conſorts. Beſide that, ſuppoſe <hi>Parſons</hi> were no open ſtickler in theſe actions; yet it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently knowne, that ſuch ſubtile practiſers do deale by ſecond, and third perſons.

If then his owne fréendes truſt not his promiſes, and othes, how ſhall we beléeue his proteſtations? Certes hée that will moſt wickedly practiſe ſuch wicked actions, he will alſo boldly denie them. Yea and this fooliſh Noddy, where he woulde cléere him, doth cléerely conuict him. For he denieth not, but that <hi>Parſons</hi> was acquainted with a gentlemans purpoſe, that reſolutely ment either to take away the Queenes life, or to looſe his owne. So it appéereth, that ſuch matters are conſulted vpon, which is the thing we ſay; and that <hi>Parſons</hi> was acquainted withall, which is by our aduerſarie denied. Indéede, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that wée are tolde, that <hi>Parſons</hi> diſſwaded the foreſaide murdrer. But that are not wée bounde to beléeue. Nay albeit hée had ſo done, yet that is not ſufficient, to excuſe him. For ſuch treaſons are to bée detected, and not onely hindred, by all honeſt men. Againe it may bée, that <hi>Parſons</hi> either in regard of the gentleman, that ſhoulde haue executed this murder, or becauſe ſuch executions woulde bring domage to their cauſe, &amp; not for loue to her Maieſty, did diſſwade this ſhameful mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and aſſaſſinate. For it appéereth both by his dealing with <hi>Hesket</hi> about the Earle of Darby; and alſo by his practiſes with the yoong prieſts, that come ouer out of Spaine, for the preferment of the Infant of Spaine to the crowne of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and by his moſt ſcandalous writings vnder the falſe names of <hi>Dolman</hi> and <hi>Philopater,</hi> which ſhall bée prooued to his face by witneſſe to bée his dooings, that hée ſéeketh nothing more, then her Maieſties diſhonor and deſtruction. And that in treaſon hée is not inferior to <hi>Allen</hi> the Cardinall, or any
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:177777:86"/> traytor theſe many yéeres executed at Tyborne.</p>
                     <p>Finally he<note n="a" place="margin">

But that they woulde ſpare her, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpared <hi>Saule,</hi> is a matter moſt vnlikely. For it appéereth, that the pope, and the Ieſuites and prieſts his agents, and al their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts haue by ſecret aſſaſinors and empoiſoners, and alſo by open murdrers, and cutthrotes ſought her death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                     <p>And ſhall ſuch agents of the pope and Spaniard, as theſe, bée ſtill ſuffred to liue, and bée ſtill maintained in diuers principall places of this lande to practiſe?

Conſider the ſequele of theſe matters, my déere countrymen, and looke well to your owne ſafetie. and if you reſpect not your ſelues, nor your owne particular; yet haue regard to the church of God, and his true religion, which you profeſſe, and ſhoulde defende, if you bée truelie religious. Reſpect the honour of your prince, your nation, your countrey. Will you abandone your ſelues to the ſpoile of proud enimies, that ſéeke your deſtruction? Will you giue credence to thoſe, that are by the Italian and Spaniard hired to ſpeake? Behold your wiues and children and déereſt friends that depend vpon the valor of your harts? Will you giue them as a praie to the cruell enimies? Repreſent to your ſelues the miſerable eſtate of this lande, if once the forreine enimie getteth footing. Your lawes ſhall bée aboliſhed, your yoong men ſhall bée ſlaine, the reſt ſhall bée vſed as ſlaues to ſerue the conquerors pleaſure. Who then will not haue care to preuent theſe dangers? Who will not beware of thoſe falſe rinegued Engliſh fugitiues, that ſéeke to bring theſe troubles vpon vs? Who had not rather die, then either ſuffer, or ſee
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:177777:86"/> theſe calamities to happen to his country and nation? In Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, and the borders of Germany not long ſince the Spaniſh ſoldiers entred as friendes; yet ſuch barbarous cruelties and outrages they committed, that they excéeded all enemies. How then do you thinke they would behaue themſelues, if they ſhould ſet foote and beginne to dominéere in England, that haue ſo rauaged countries, that eyther were friendes, or neutrales? The onely way is to ſecure your ſelues of falſe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Ieſuites, prieſtes and their conſorts. Theſe Ieſuites are vntollerable in ſtates that profeſſe popery, much more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought they to be ſuſpect and odious to vs. The parliament of Paris by a ſolemne arreſt or decrée did<note n="a" place="margin">Records of parliam. of Paris.</note> baniſh the whole ſociety or rather verminaille of Ieſuites out of France, <hi>As cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters of youth, perturbers of publike peace, and enemies to the king, and to the ſtate.</hi> The colledge of diuines in Paris by a ſolemne act of all the company did condemne this order, as dangerous both to church and common wealth. <hi>Haec ſocietas</hi> ſay the doctors of Sorbone, <hi>videtur in negotio fidei periculo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, pacis eccleſiae perturbatiua, &amp; magis in deſtructionem, quàm aedificationem.</hi> The reaſons why they deſcended to pronounce this hard ſentence againſt them, deſerue much to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

Shall their owne ſort and companions driue them out of their ſtates, and ſhall any honeſt man make queſtion, whether it be lawfull to make lawes againſt them, and to procéede againſt them? Why do we not looke vpon Scotland, and ſée both the miſchieuous plots of Ieſuites there, and their condigne puniſhments?

But if wée conſider, that the Ieſuites do not ſuffer any man of meane ſpirite to returne, before they haue either entangled him in ſome trecherous practiſe, or tainted him with the leuen of their hereſies, or both; we ſhall eaſily perceiue, that this milde courſe and enlargement of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners was rather to worke a correſpondence with vs, and a remiſſeneſſe in our ſoldiers, and mariners, that they ſhoulde not aduenture, as in times paſt, knowing that they ſhould bée ſent for England, and alſo a maine miſchiefe to the ſtate; then to do our people any fauor, or kindneſſe.

                           <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.</note> Chriſt, that was moſt méeke, and gentle as a lambe, then of theſe ſauage men, that in their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie excéed woolues, and ſhew themſelues moſt vnlike to Chriſt, or catholike Chriſtians. God forbid therefore, that we ſhould perſwade, or like any rigorous courſe to bée taken with ſuch papiſts as offend onely of ſimplicitie, &amp; neuer knew any other religion but poperie; and neither practiſe againſt her Maieſty, nor the ſtate, nor true religion, nor adhere to thoſe that doe it. Howbeit, if any abuſe their libertie, and this rare clemency of the ſtate to maintaine a faction, and either ſéeke to ſtirre vp ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or to oppreſſe true religion, and thoſe that maintaine it, or elſe adhere, receit, and fauour ſuch: it ſhoulde not onely not ſauour of clemencie to fauour ſuch, but alſo worke a diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both of eccleſiaſticall and ciuill gouernment, to ſuffer them. For to ſuffer gods worſhip to be abrogated, and idolatrie and falſe religion to bée eſtabliſhed, and Chriſts people to bée ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by falſe teachers, is plaine impietie: to giue way to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and ſeditious practiſes againſt her Maieſtie, or the ſtate, or to winke at them, or neglect them, is plaine diſloialty, and vnnaturall trecherie: to nouriſh in our boſomes ſuch, as either woulde bring in ſtrangers vpon vs, or elſe ſéeke oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to cut our throtes themſelues, is brutiſh ſtupidity.</p>

Secondly<note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.</note> God appointed Chriſtian princes to bée <hi>Foſter fathers, &amp; Queenes to be nurſing mothers to his church.</hi> And therefore may they not ſée either God diſhonored by falſe religion and idolatrie, or true Chriſtians oppreſſed with force, or trecherie.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie doctrine to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of Chriſt? Fourthly it was euer the cuſtom of chriſtian princes to puniſh falſe teachers, as appéereth<note n="e" place="margin">L. Quicunque Cod. de haeretic.</note> by the law of <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Martian</hi> emperors. <hi>Vltimo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicio afficiantur,</hi> ſay the emperors, <hi>qui illicita docere tentaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint.</hi> And that <hi>Hierome</hi> writing vpon the fift to the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans doth allow, miſliking that <hi>Arius</hi> eſcaped ſo long vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Laſtly the aduerſaries will not ſuffer true preachers to teach truth. Why then ſhoulde their prieſts and friers be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to teach hereſie and falſhoode? Will they giue lawe to others, and not endure themſelues to be ordered by lawe? Nothing can be deuiſed more vnreaſonable, or more repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to<note n="f" place="margin">L. <hi>1.</hi> ff. quod quiſque iuris.</note> lawe. Whatſoeuer libertie therefore is granted to ſimple people abuſe by falſe teachers; that concerneth Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, prieſts, and other falſe teachers nothing.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond point is prooued by lawes of nations, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary rules of ſtate. For all nations do puniſh ſuch as prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe againſt the princes perſon, and the ſecurity of the ſtate, as offending in the higheſt degrée of treaſon: and mere ſimplicity it is reputed, to ſuffer any to liue in a ſtate, that entendeth, or practiſeth the deſtruction of the ſtate.

Neither is it materiall, that theſe practiſers, be they Ieſuites, prieſtes, or whatſoeuer elſe, do pretend a certaine kinde of religion, ſéeing their end is war and rebellion; their meanes, faction and diuiſion; and their maintayners, and vpholders, publike enemies of the prince and ſtate.</p>
                     <p>The third point is taught vs by the inſtinct of nature. For euen light of nature ſheweth euery liuing creature, how to prouide for his owne ſafety, and to decline and auoide ſuch things, as may ſéeme hurtfull. And reaſon teacheth man to draw himſelfe into ſome ſociety, and common wealth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may be in ſafety from his enemies. For this cauſe euery man, that is not tranſported with ſtrange paſſion loueth to liue vnder law and gouernment, and to hate thoſe, that would diſſolue lawes and lawfull gouernment. Howſoeuer then we fauour ſeduced papiſtes, yet vnleſſe we will ſhew our ſelues deuoide of naturall reaſon, we may not ſhew our ſelues negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in ſéeking the ſafety of our ſelues, and the mainteinance of lawes, and gouernment, wherein our ſafety in part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth. We may not neglect the ſafety of thoſe, that depend vpon vs: but euery man according to his place is to reſiſt ſuch, as ſeeke our liues, and the liues of thoſe, that are committed to vs, or do depend vpon vs.</p>
                     <p>In theſe thrée pointes or any of them it is not lawfull to offend by any law. The papiſtes, I thinke, will not ſay, that any man, that eyther teacheth falſe religion, or practiſeth againſt the prince or ſtate, or by ſedition ſéeketh to hurt his countrymen, and to murder them, is to eſcape vnpuniſhed. Wherefore then ſhould they miſlike any, that teacheth, that ſuch offendors are to be puniſhed? If, I ſay, all were puniſhed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:177777:91"/> within theſe caſes, yet were it good iuſtice, &amp; very neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit ſuch is the clemency of her Maieſties gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſhe ſpareth Ieſuites, prieſtes, and ſuch falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers (as ſome thinke) but too much. Obſtinate recuſants if they be not taken in ſome practiſe of treaſon, are not in danger eyther of life, or landes, or liberty: they are not baniſhed, nor rigorouſly puniſhed. Nay their onely puniſhment is a pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary mulct, and that of few exacted. The poorer ſort eſcape al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without puniſhment: the richer do auoid the puniſhment by trauerſing the enditement. In Spaine and Italy our brethren would accompt ſuch puniſhments great fauour.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore ſéeing this Noddy our aduerſary knoweth the rigour of popiſh inquiſitors againſt true Chriſtians, and by this may well perceiue her Maieſties great clemency exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, not onely to quiet papiſtes, that liue priuate without ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale, but alſo to obſtinate and factious recuſantes, yea and to notorious traitors; hée was not wiſe either to challenge his aduerſarie for ſpeaking of Recuſants ſo moderately, or to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe this ſtate of iniuſtice, that ſheweth ſuch extraordinarie fauour towards them, that ſo little deſerue it.</p>
                     <p>Hée chargeth his aduerſarie <hi>With playing the Herodian,</hi> bicauſe he ſaith, <hi>that diuers Recuſants vnder a viſor of ciuill ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie do couer diſloyall harts.</hi> But if hée had done him right, hée ſhoulde rather haue thanked him for commending their ciuill cariage, which is more then their inſolencie of late much encreaſed, deſerueth. That it is true, which ſir <hi>Francis Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings</hi> affirmeth, if his face were not armed with a viſor of impudencie, hée woulde not haue denied. Both reaſon and experience doth teach it to bée moſt true. For if hée bée a true papiſt, then muſt hée liue in ſubiection to the pope, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his authoritie.<note n="a" place="margin">C. vnam. extr. de Maior. &amp; Obed.</note>

                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> holdeth him out of the church, that is not vnder the popes obedience. <hi>Noſtra ſententia eſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>eccleſiam vnam &amp; veram eſſe caetum hominum eiuſdem chriſtianae fidei profeſſione, &amp; eorundem ſacramentorum communione colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatum ſub regimine legitimorum paſtorum, ac praecipuè vnius Chriſti in terris vicarij Romani Pontificis.</hi> This is likewiſe <hi>Turrians,</hi> and <hi>Stapletons</hi> opinion.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:177777:91"/> allow his ſentence of excommunication againſt the Queene, and ioine with him in depoſing her, or elſe they are no partes of the Romiſh church. But if they ſhall either ſo thinke, or do; they can bée no true ſubiects. Secondly<note n="a" place="margin">Lib <hi>2.</hi> de Pontif. Rom.</note> 
                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that it is a matter of faith, <hi>To beleeue that the pope by Chriſts ordinance hath ſucceeded Peter in the vniuerſall gouernment of the church.</hi> But hée that beléeueth ſo much, as all papiſts are bounde to do, cannot acknowledge the princes royall authoritie in eccleſiaſticall cauſes, nor exclude the pope from it, and per conſequent, muſt néedes bée but a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſubiect to her Maieſtie. Thirdly all papiſts are<note n="b" place="margin">Bellar. lib <hi>4.</hi> de Pontif. Rom.</note> bound to beléeue, <hi>That the popes ſentence in matters of faith is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and that, what hée iudgeth, is done by Chriſtes authority, in whoſe tribunall ſeate hée pretendeth to ſit. Neceſſarie it is therefore, that all papiſts allow the popes ſentence of depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt her Maieſtie. If they denie it, they are not of the right touch of papiſts: if they grant it, they are euill qualified ſubiects. But what ſhall wée néede arguments to prooue this, when as experience doth euidently prooue it vnto vs? Is it not apparent, how little reaſon her Maieſtie hath to truſt them? In the beginning of her reigne the popiſh prelates refuſed to crowne her, one onely excepted. Afterward the popiſh clergie for the moſt part fledde out of the lande, and left her. By their ſolicitation, the pope began to ſtirre againſt her. Preſently vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his excommunication the rebellion began in the north. Theſe kinde of men ſtirred vp diuers rebellions in Ireland. Neither haue they ceaſed at any time, to enterpriſe either one deuiſe, or other to hurt vs here in England. Sir <hi>Francis</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth greatly diminiſh their deſerts, and ſpare them where hée ſaith onely, <hi>They haue deceitfull harts.</hi> And moſt fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie doth the ſtate deale with them, for refuſing to come to church to ſerue God, ſéeing their conſorts do burne and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der godly men, for not comming to their idolatrous ſeruice, and abominable maſſe.</p>
                     <p>He calleth thoſe, that refuſe to go to our churches, <hi>The better and more religious ſort of catholickes.</hi> But he is not of God, that refuſeth to heare his word. Neither are they to be tearmed catholickes, that haue a priuate religion to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues deuiſed by the pope, nor are they truely religious, that vnderſtand not the principles of Chriſtian faith, nor will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

                     <p>Where it is ſaid, that ſome papiſtes <hi>Shew foorth a good outward ciuill cariage,</hi> this Noddy wiſely concludeth, <hi>That ſir Francis maketh light of good life,</hi> and thereupon taketh occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to runne out into a common place of good workes. But héere was no place for him to trie his ſkill. For ſir <hi>Francis</hi> doth neither condemne good workes, nor good life, but rather the hypocriticall ſhewe of both, where indeede neither is to bée founde. Nay poore ſoules, the papiſts do not ſo much, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, what workes are good, what not. They ſay their <hi>Oraiſons,</hi> and <hi>Credo,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aue Maria</hi> in Latin; and vnderſtand not, what they ſay. They créepe to the croſſe and kiſſe it. On fridaies they eate fiſh, and abſteine from white meates in lent. They croſſe themſelues, confeſſe their faults in the prieſtes eare, put on haire cloth, and follow ſuch like fancies; refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to heare true doctrine, and Gods truth.

                     <p>As for Recuſantes I know no works they do, but ſuch, as if they were wiſe, they would be aſhamed of them.

Beſide that the confeſſors and yoong prieſts are ſo familiar with their wiues, that they are made liker oxen, then lyons. But this idle vagabond frier, that liueth idly vpon the ſweate of other mens browes and diſdeineth to labour, ſcorneth al huſbandry, and honeſt trauaile. So ſtrange is their doctrine, that they woulde alter not onely Chriſtes religion, but alſo rules of ſtate, and houſhold.</p>
                     <p>Where ſir <hi>Francis</hi> telleth vs, <hi>That he knoweth by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, what hurt womens perſwaſions haue done in hardening their husbands harts in matters of religion,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>That the night crowes perſwaſion preuaileth much.</hi> Hée gibeth at the terme of Night crowes, and chargeth the knight with <hi>Playing the part either of Iudas to betray Recuſants, or of Pilate to condemne them, or afflict them.</hi> But firſt there is great oddes betwixt the recuſants, that haue nothing either of Chriſt, or of good chriſtians, but the bare name; &amp; Chriſt Ieſus our ſauior. Hée refuſed not to come into the temple though abuſed, nor ſought to betray his nation into the hands of high prieſts, and forreine enimies. Theſe refuſe to come to Gods church, and are the high prieſts of Romes ſeruants, and many of them haue too great affection to forreine enimies.

And therefore may they wel be reſembled to black night crowes, that are ſtill cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in their huſbands eares, and entiſing them both to opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and workes of darkneſſe. Beſide this theſe nightcrowes are too familiar oftentimes with night walking prieſts &amp; Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, that teach them new faſhions of ſhrift, and draw them into euill opinions, and dangerous practiſes. In Venice they encroched ſo farre vpon the womens fauour, that their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands forbad them to come any more néere the Ieſuites. Like fauour haue the Ieſuites obtained at the handes of the goodwiues of Milan. By meanes of the wiues of Friburge the Ieſuites attempted to ſet diſſenſion betwixt the Cantons of Suizzerland. We may not therefore thinke it ſtrange, if tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous prieſtes worke their feates by the meanes of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                     <p>Where it is ſaide, that by the leud perſwaſions of Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant women many fall away, our aduerſarie aſketh, <hi>Whether they fall to enormitie of ſinne, or wickedneſſe of life.</hi> As if the Recuſants were ſuch ſaints, that they coulde not fall to ſinne, or wickedneſſe. Certes the common opinion is otherwiſe. For commonly Recuſants make lechery and ribaldrie to bée no great ſinne. And their women make it more nice to go to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:177777:93"/> Gods church, then to go to ſtrangers beds. It is well knowne, that papiſts allow of bordels, and<note n="a" place="margin">C. at ſi clerici. De iudi ijs.</note> account adulterie and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication ſmall faults, and eaſilie they diſpence with them. Heerein England the prieſts corrupted the Gailors daughter of Wiſbich, and another prieſt ranne away with one of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamies</hi> maides. Nay there is a prieſt in England, that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed how hee ſhriued fewe women, but hee lay with them. And yet the ſimple Recuſants neither feele their owne ſhame, nor prouide remedie againſt theſe prieſts of <hi>Baal.</hi> Beſide that, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants are often drawne into ſtrange and diſloial practiſes, as appeereth by the examples of <hi>Arden,</hi> &amp; <hi>Someruil, Babington, Tichborne</hi> and many others. But to omit filthineſſe of life and trecherie; it is fall great inough, that ſimple men oft by leud perſwaſions fall into the errors and hereſies of poperie, ſo many and ſo gréeuous; that popery, as it conteineth nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties aboue the doctrine which wee profeſſe, is nothing but a packe of hereſies: as wee ſhall particularly ſhewe héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                     <p>But ſaith the diſcourſer, <hi>They are catholikes, and haue a ſcruple to go to the Proteſtants churches, becauſe they thinke their religion is naught.</hi> And thereupon hée concludeth, <hi>That religion and conſcience is cauſe of their refuſall, and not euill will or rebellion.</hi> But the poore idiots are much abuſed, where they are perſwaded that either their owne religion is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, or that ours is not catholike. This is a common ſong, which the popiſh prieſts ſing in their eares, but the note is iarring, and the dittie can neuer bée prooued. Catholike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was that which the apoſtles taught generally through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the worlde; and that is the religion which wée profeſſe in our Créede, and finde written in holy ſcriptures. All which we holde, and refuſe all doctrine contrarie to the ſame. But the papiſts in their ſchoolemens commentaries and popiſh decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and wicked miſſals and portuiſes, and ſuch like bookes of Romiſh deuotion, haue brought in, not onely a faith diuers from the apoſtolike, and catholike faith, but alſo contrarie to the ſame. Much therefore do we pittie the blindneſſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants, that not onely ſhut their eies againſt the light, and condemne that for hereſie, which indéede is truely catholike, but alſo embrace falſhood and hereſies for true religion, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping angels, ſaints, and the virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> yea ſtockes,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:177777:94"/> rotten bones and rags, in ſtead of one true God, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing antichriſt in ſtead of Chriſt. And all this they do, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelues and their religion either vpon lying legends, or popiſh decretals, or vncertaine cuſtomes neuer vſed in the catholike church. So that heerein there is neither one ſcrpule of true religion, nor any dramme of conſcience, but onelie blindneſſe and wilfulneſſe, of which afterward enſueth vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall vnkindneſſe towards their prince and countrie, and wicked practiſes hurtfull to themſelues &amp; their déereſt friends and countrimen. Neither can it excuſe them, <hi>That they are ſo perſwaded in their conſcience.</hi> For all conſcience ought to bée grounded on right reaſon, and not vpon this, or that fancy. Therefore the<note n="a" place="margin">Thomas aq. <hi>1.</hi> p. q. <hi>79.</hi> art. <hi>12.</hi> &amp; Siluest. in verb. conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia.</note> ſchoolemen ſay, <hi>Quod conſcientia eſt actus ſyntereſis.</hi> But this <hi>ſyntereſis</hi> is nothing, but a facultie of the minde, wherein are principles naturally knowne preſerued.

And this properly is conſcience. But there is alſo another conſcience, when wée conclude not from the light of naturall reaſon, but from the knowledge of Gods worde. And this conſcience concluding from rules of true religion is moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to bee followed. But if it conclude otherwiſe, it is no conſcience, but rather an opinion and fancie, and priuate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and pretenſe of conſcience.</p>
                     <p>But ſaith this diſcourſer, <hi>A man is to follow his conſcience, though it do erre,</hi> and afterward hée telleth vs, <hi>That an erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſcience doth both binde, and excuſe:</hi> and this he goeth about to prooue, and maintaine. But his diſpute of conſcience is ſuch, as he ſheweth himſelfe to bée ignorant both of reaſon, diuinitie, and conſcience; and that he knoweth neither what is truth, nor what his owne conſorts teach. That an erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſcience is not to bée followed, it is apparent, for that our conſcience is not a rule of our actions, but the lawe of God. For that is <hi>A lanterne to our feete, and a light to our pathes.</hi> And<note n="c" place="margin">In <hi>2.</hi> ſent. dist. <hi>39.</hi>

                        <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> doth in expreſſe termes deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, <hi>Quod conſcientia non ligat, vel obligat virtute propria, ſed aliena, id eſt praecepti diuini.</hi> So that it alwaies tieth vs to the law, and not againſt the law.

Thirdly grant this, that an erronious conſcience is to bée followed, and then it will follow, that idolaters are to worſhip idols, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes to continue in their errors, &amp; Mahometans to followe the impieties of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> for that the conſcience of euerie of theſe erring, doth perſwade them, that they are in the right. Laſtly if an erronious conſcience bée to bée followed, then were not an erronious conſcience to bée changed, but we were ſtill to continue in error. But contrary to this do ſchoolemen determine. <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> ſaith<note n="a" place="margin">Sum. Syluest. in verb. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia.</note> 
                        <hi>Sylueſter Prierius, vtrum homo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neatur erreneam conſcientiam deponere,</hi> and to this queſtion hée anſwereth, <hi>quod tenetur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That an erroneous conſcience ſhould excuſe any, is yet more abſurd. For firſt we are not to be iudged according to our opinion of matters, but according to Gods law. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if euery man were to be excuſed vpon his owne perſwaſion, then neyther ſhould idolaters, turkes, nor heretikes be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Thirdly<note n="b" place="margin">1. 2. <hi>q</hi> 19. <hi>art.</hi> 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> doth determine, that an erring conſcience excuſeth not: <hi>Voluntas</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Concordans rationi erranti poteſt eſſe mala.</hi> To conclude this point, the ſame is prooued by reaſon. For if a conſcience erring excuſe, then if a man ſhould thinke he might do well to kill his freind, or brother, or to betray his countrie; he were to be excuſed.</p>
                     <p>That an erroneous conſcience bindeth not vs, to beléeue that which we thinke to be true, and is not, nor to do that which we thinke to be good, and is not; is prooued, for that, if this were granted, diuers inconueniences would enſue. For then it ſhould follow, that the Turkes that are perſwaded in their conſcience, that it is not good to beleeue in Chriſt, were bound not to beléeue in Chriſt, and that ſuch as in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are perſwaded to kill any body, or to commit any flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious act, are bound to do it; and finally our conſciences and priuate opinions ſhould be the rule of our actions, and not the law of God.</p>
                     <p>Neyther are our aduerſaries reaſons of any force to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary. He ſaith <hi>firſt, that our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience is nothing, but the determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our reaſon about matters to be done or not to be done.</hi> But his definition is very imperfect, for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience as
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:177777:95"/> well concerneth beléefe, as action. Beſide it concerneth thinges paſt, as well as to come, as his owne ſchoole doctors could teach him, if he had read them. Thirdly it is not properly the determination of euery mans owne reaſon, but of true reaſon according to the generall rules, that are kept in Syntereſt, and (if we vnderſtand conſcience generally) according to the rules eyther of Gods law, or the goſpell. Laſtly albeit conſcience is the determination of reaſon, yet are we not bound to folow that reaſon, be it right or wrong, as he doth thereof inferre; but rather we are bound to change our erroneous conſcience, and to learne what the law of God is, that we may onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue and do that is right, and auoyde the contrary. And this law is ſuch, that euery one is bound to take notice of it; ſo that he cannot pretend ignorance, or that he hath no light, but the light of his owne blind reaſon.</p>
                     <p>He ſaith further, <hi>That the quality of mans will is meaſured according to the obiect, that mooueth the will: as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>He that thinketh he killeth his enemy, when he hitteth a beaſt in a buſh, ſinneth.</hi> But while he thinketh he ſpeaketh like a ſchooleman, &amp; a great clerke, he ſpeaketh, if not like a beaſt in a buſh, yet like a weake diuine. For firſt there is great difference betwixt the will and the conſcience, and therefore his purpoſe of will, fitteth not the matter in hand, that concerneth conſcience: neither doth the example fit the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of conſcience, béeing onely concerning the purpoſe of a mans will, that bindeth according to the fact intended, albeit the effect enſue not. Againe if by this example he be able to prooue, that a wrong conſcience is to be folowed, then might a man lawfully ſhoot at his enemie in a buſh, like a foxe, becauſe his erroneous will, or as this Noddy termeth it conſcience leadeth him vnto it. Finally <hi>Thomas</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">1. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 19. <hi>art.</hi> 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Aquinas</hi> doth teach di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrary, viz, <hi>That a mans will agreeing with a falſe reaſon or ground may be naught.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly he alleadgeth out of Saint <hi>Paul. Rom. 14.</hi> and <hi>1. Cor. 8. That to eat meat ſacrificed to idols, ſimply without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, whether it was ſuch meat or no, is no ſinne.</hi> But this is nothing to our queſtion, that is about an erroneous conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For he that eateth ſuch meates ſimply, ſéemeth to make no conſcience of that matter. And albeit Saint <hi>Paul condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him that eateth ſuch ſacrificed meat contrary to conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi>
                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:177777:95"/> yet doth he not ſpeake of a mans owne conſcience, but of an other mans conſcience. <hi>Conſcientiam,</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> ſaith hée, <hi>dico non tuam, ſed alterius.</hi> and Rom. <hi>14.</hi> he ſaith, it is good not to eate or to drink any thing, wherein our brother may be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Againe there is great difference betwixt him, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a conſcience to abſteine from things in themſelues not ſimply vnlawfull, and him that reſolueth to do things vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or to leaue things commaunded vndone. The apoſtle ſpeaketh of the firſt, our queſtion is of the ſecond kind of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as is euident by our aduerſaries wordes, who teacheth, that if our conſciences perſwade vs to do any thing; that we are bound to do it, although our reaſon lead vs wrong. Which is contrary not onely to the apoſtle, but alſo to the ſchoolemen. The apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Whatſoeuer is not of faith,</hi> or a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>is ſinne.</hi> And the ſchoolemen teach, as I haue ſhewed, that an erroneous conſcience is not to be folowed, but rather forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. So that if we folow the apoſtles rule, then thoſe that vpon falſe perſwaſions abſtaine from hearing Gods eternall word, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating with vs in the ſacraments, and that go to idole ſeruice, and eat bread, that is made an idole, do offend gréeuouſly; for that this cannot procéede of conſcience, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is againſt good conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly he aſſureth vs, <hi>That the conſcience of papiſtes, that refuſe to go to the church is grounded vpon ſo ſure and euident groundes, as any demonſtration in the world can lay downe.</hi> And his ground is this, <hi>That the religion profeſſed by papiſtes is true, and that therefore they may not ſeeme to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe any other.</hi> And here he thinketh he ſtandeth firme &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooueable. But if this be his ground, his building is founded vpon ſand, and vpon a cleare vntruth. For neither ſhall he euer be able to diſprooue that truth, which we profeſſe, nor to iuſtifie thoſe pointes of popiſh religion, which we condemne.

                     <p>Fiftly hée telleth vs, <hi>That wee do greatly diſcredite our doctrine, which wee were woont to teach, viz.

Wée ſay as wée did euer, that the conſcience neither ought to bée forced with tortures and terrors of death neither can be forced. For faith founded vpon ſure groundes ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth all violence of tyrants, and crueltie of perſecutors, which terrifieth and diſcourageth none taught rightlie in Chriſts ſchoole.

                        <hi>veſture is red with the blood of Saints,</hi> and which without difference of age, ſexe, or qualitie tortureth, hangeth, burneth and killeth true Chriſtians, it is odious not onely to thoſe that vnderſtand the truth, but alſo to the milder ſort of the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. Further albeit no man can bée forced to religion; yet all gentle courſes are to bée vſed to draw men to religion. For this cauſe wée exhort the weake and ignorant, and with pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niarie mulctes wée repreſſe thoſe, that are wilfull and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. And this is all the puniſhment, that her Maieſtie vſeth againſt recuſants: too little certes, if wee reſpect either their deſerts, or the malice of our enimies: neither do we thinke it either vnlawfull to procéed further againſt hereticall teachers, that corrupt Chriſts doctrine with their leuen; or ſufferable, that notorious blaſphemers and railers at religion ſhoulde eſcape vnpuniſhed. So then wee beléeue, that religion is to be taught, and not by terrors, thruſt vpon the people: and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie not, but that ſuch as bee wilfull diſturbers of the ſtate of the church, or common-welth ought to bée puniſhed. Neither is there any repugnance betwixt theſe two courſes. Onelie
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:177777:96"/> let papiſts abſteine from practiſes, and for the reſt they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured both of life &amp; libertie, lands and goods.

                     <p>Finally he doth preferre the orders of the popiſh ſynagogue that burneth not onely thoſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> forſake their religion,<note n="a" place="margin">The papists cannot diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their bloody crueltie.</note> but ſuch alſo as will not come vnto their religion. The popes religion he calleth, <hi>The faith of all Chriſtendome,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>That ſuch as thinke hardly thereof, ought rather to be barred from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the church, then drawne thither.</hi> Wherein he ſheweth firſt his cruelty and bloudy humor, that ſeemeth to reioyce in ſlaughter, and commendeth the woluiſh nature of the Romiſh ſynagogue. Secondly his folly and treacherie, that betraying his clients cauſe, would haue them puniſhed with death. For if all that forſake the faith of Chriſt and his apoſtles be to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death, then will it go hard with his clients the recuſantes, who pretending catholicke faith, indeede do embrace the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate doctrine and faction of popes. Thirdly his impudency, that dare auouch the popiſh religion to be the faith of all Chriſtendome, which notwithſtanding is contradicted by the eaſterne churches, and forſaken of a great part of the weſt church, and is onely maintained by fire and ſword and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Laſtly his ignorance in teaching religion, that would haue ſuch as do not like all points of faith, to bée barred out of the church. Which courſe neither by our Sauiour, nor by his apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles nor by any true teachers of Chriſtianitie was euer prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed. Nay our Sauiour inuiteth all to come to him, &amp; when hée had made readie to feaſt his friends, woulde haue gueſtes compelled to come in. Likewiſe the apoſtles taught all that came, and opened their armes to embrace all, that were deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to learne. The ancient fathers by all meanes ſought to draw people to the church, and ſhut the doores againſt none, that was willing to come in. What then ſhoulde we thinke of the aduerſaries, but as of enimies of Chriſt &amp; true religion, that ſeeke to murder and famiſh Chriſts flocke? In the meane while let vs holde on our courſe, and with our Sauiour call al men, and refuſe none that are willing to heare. And thus an ende of the firſt conſideration that concerneth the hurt that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:177777:97"/> popiſh Recuſants do.</p>
                     <p>Next we are to conſider, <hi>What hurt they would do,</hi> &amp; that briefly. Now that is apparent, Firſt by their hatred againſt religion, and all that profeſſe the ſame. And Secondly by their affection toward forreine enimies, and cold deuotion to her Maieſtie and the preſent gouernment. Their hatred againſt religion is ſo extreme, that they will not ſuffer any to liue, that profeſſe the ſame. Their affection to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pope is excéeding, when for his ſake they forget their loue to their countrie, and duty to their prince, as appéereth euidently by many examples. and as they hate true religion, &amp; the preſent gouernment; ſo they ſéeke the eſtabliſhment of idolatrie and other points of poperie, and the whole alteration of the preſent ſtate. Of which the firſt cannot bée done without the ſubuerſion of the church, nor the later without the deſolation of this countrey. Two points ſo materiall, that no true Chriſtian can endure the firſt, nor true Engliſhman the latter. Our aduerſarie ſuppoſeth, that the maſſe and the popes gouernment may well ſtande with her Maieſties ſecuritie. But popiſh religion hath many tricks, beſide the maſſe; and the popes gouernment, if it were receiued as the Ieſuites teach it, admitteth no other ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie either in eccleſiaſticall, or politicall affaires, beſide the popes. Neither maſſe nor pope can come into England, either with the ſafetie of her Maieſtie, or the ſtate. And this wée do not ſpeake by gueſſes at the wiſhes of papiſts, as our aduerſarie ſuppoſeth; but by experience of former practiſes, and reaſons deduced out of the grounds of Romiſh religion, and the practiſe of Romiſh procéedings. Of which wée haue ſpoken héeretofore, and ſhall alſo haue occaſion to ſpeake more at large héereafter.</p>
                     <p>The thirde point to be conſidered is, <hi>Whether the Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants do not diſſemble deepely, and in hart ſtand euill affected to her Maieſtie, their countrey, and all that profeſſe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</hi> In handling whereof our aduerſarie paſſeth a little the limits of patience, and giueth ſir <hi>Francis</hi> euill language, and<note place="margin">
                           <hi>P.</hi> 80.</note> chargeth him, <hi>That he hath no care, nor conſcience in accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo many cacolike men of England, and that of ſuch hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crimes.</hi> But high treaſons are not anſwered with high wordes. Neither can heinous crimes bée daſhed out with flat and bold denials. We find by experience, that all the troubles,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:177777:97"/> that ſince the beginning of her Maieſties reigne vnto this time haue happened to this ſtate, haue procéeded wholie from the malice of papiſts. The rebellion in the north parts of this realme was raiſed by <hi>Nicholas Morton</hi> and other prieſts, when as yet there was almoſt neither act nor lawe made againſt papiſts. When they coulde not preuaile in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, they raiſed great broiles in Ireland. Beſide domeſticall rebellions they haue ſtirred vp forreine enimies and warres againſt this ſtate. <hi>Philip</hi> of Spaine at the inſtance of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh traitors determined both by ſea and land to make warre vpon vs. By procurement, and practiſe of this faction the Duke of Alua, the Duke of Guiſe, and <hi>Don Iuan d'Auſtria</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came our enimies. Likewiſe if wée looke into ſecret practiſes, either againſt her Maieſties life, or againſt the ſtate; wée ſhall finde, that all the plots were contriued and determined to bée executed by papiſts. <hi>William Parry, Somerfield, Arden, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bington, Ballard, Patrick Ocollen,</hi> and all thoſe murderers, and empoiſoners, that of late time haue practiſed againſt her Maieſtie were papiſts, and ſet on by papiſts. Onely <hi>Lopez,</hi> as is ſaid, was a Iew. So papiſts and Iewes conſpire ioint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt this ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Of their hatred againſt religion, and the true profeſſors thereof there is no queſtion to be made. Darkeneſſe cannot ſtand with light, nor canne the ſonnes of Beliall abide Chriſts true diſciples. No papiſt will endure to be excommunicate by the pope; but if hée ſhoulde not perſecute Chriſtians vpon his commandement, he ſhoulde bée excommunicate and accurſed. Nay albeit they woulde be content to liue in peace, yet will not the Ieſuites and ſeditious prieſtes ſuffer them to reſt. Theſe raiſed the league, or rather the rebellion againſt the French king, and warres againſt the profeſſors of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Theſe are the agents of antichriſt to mooue princes to warre againſt the lambe, and thoſe that follow him.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it to bée preſuppoſed, that they can continue in their allegiance to her Maieſtie, when they acknowledge the popes authoritie. <hi>Praecipimus</hi> ſaith<note n="a" place="margin">In bulla Pij <hi>5.</hi> aduerſ. Elizabeth.</note>

They may now temporize. So do alſo all rebels, vntill their matters grow ripe. They may likewiſe profeſſe and proteſt déepely. For ſo did <hi>Parry, Lopez,</hi> and the earles of Weſtmerland and Northumberland. But why ſhoulde any thinke our papiſts to be of other nature, then the papiſts of France, and other countries, that neuer cared for promiſe, nor oath, ſo they might attaine their purpoſe? Shall not wée while wee haue meanes, prouide for our ſafety, and the ſafetie of the ſtate? Our aduerſarie<note n="a" place="margin">

                        </q> So wée may ſay, the Spaniards are dangerous enimies, the pope and his agents more, the Recuſant and domeſticall mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content is moſt dangerous. Neither are they hard harted men, and without piety and conſcience, that ſo thinke of them; but theſe rather, that oppugne true pietie and religion, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine idolatrie and ſuperſtition, and preferre ſtrangers before their owne countreymen, hazarding the deſtruction of their owne nation and countrey, that is like to enſue, if the popes purpoſes, which they do fauour, and vnder paine of his curſe

But our fugitiue Engliſh albeit no man forceth them to embrace hereſie, or ſéeketh their life, yet flie they like traytors to forraine enemies, and there conſpire againſt the prince and ſtate; and al to eſtabliſh their popiſh he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and to erect idolatry.</p>
                     <p>His authorities likewiſe are impertinent to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

But where there is no oppoſition betwixt Chriſt, and our countrey and people, there this rule taketh no place. What do thoſe then deſerue, that not onely forſake their countrey and kinred, but Chriſt alſo, and true religion? Againe albeit wée may not forſake Chriſt though wée ſhoulde looſe countrey, kinred, life and all; yet may not godly Chriſtians ſéeke the deſtruction of their prince and countrey, nor to bring in ſtrangers. This is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither without the compaſſe of the text; and Engliſh rebels, that flie to the enimy, haue no warrant ſo to do in theſe words. As for <hi>Wyats</hi> enterpriſe wée are not bound to defend it. And yet it is cléere, that hée ment no hurt to the Quéene, or to the realme, but good rather, ſéeking to driue out ſtrangers, whoſe comming coulde not chooſe but bée hurtfull to this land, and dangerous. In France and Scotland thoſe of the religion did onely ſéeke to defend themſelues againſt force, and not to hurt their princes; they repelled thoſe that pretended the

For it is one thing to continue in allegiance and ſubiection to princes, and another to obey or execute their wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. This Chriſtians are not to do, bicauſe they are to obey God, rather then man. Yet may they not rebell againſt their princes, nor may they ſeeke to depoſe them, and murder them, as the papiſts teach and practiſe.

                        </gap> ſignifying both creature, and ordinance or election, wée are to chooſe the fitteſt ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Secondly it is no part of ſir <hi>Francis</hi> his meaning to teach an abſolute obedience to bée due to temporall princes. Nay hée thinketh it neither due to temporall, nor eccleſiaſtical magiſtrates, ſaue onely in things lawfull. But this the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts denie to princes in eccleſiaſticall externall gouernment ſimplie; and in temporall cauſes too, if the pope do excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them, or depoſe them. Thirdly ſir <hi>Francis</hi> did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage this place to prooue that papiſts were to go to church vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the princes commandement, but rather to ſhewe, that they ought not to rebell againſt princes vpon the popes warrant, as they do very often. And thus all this matter, about which the Noddy maketh ſo great exclamations, is eaſily cléered, and all his calumniations and cauillations at his aduerſaries per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and writings anſwered. It reſteth therefore nowe, that we conſider a little of his braue ſpeake made in the latter end of this chapter to the Recuſants. Perhaps he is better able to teach them, what they are to do héereafter, then to defend that is done already.</p>
                     <p>Firſt hée telleth vs, <hi>That hee can ſay no more to cacolike Recuſants,</hi> then that which followeth. Which ſheweth, that hée hath little to ſay in their defence, and leſſe for their inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then hée pronounceth in his graue voice, <hi>That the courſe which they haue taken is moſt honorable, and pious before God and man; and that forſooth in three points: firſt in ſhewing their dutie towards God by ſtanding conſtantly, and ſuffering for their conſcience. Secondly in offring all loyal obedience in temporall cauſes to their liege prince; and laſtly in edifying their neighbors by their good life, and behauiour.</hi> But what if they haue neither ſhewed their dutie to God, nor
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:177777:100"/> ſuffered for their conſcience; nor offered loyall obedience to their prince, nor haue ſo taken her; nor haue either by their beléefe or life edified their neighbors? May we not then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that their courſe is neither pious nor honorable; and that albeit they eſcape the cenſures of men, yet aſſuredly they ſhall anſwere before God? Nay what if for religion they maintaine ſuperſtition, for loyaltie nouriſh in their boſomes trecherie and diſloialtie, and ruinate their neighbours by their euill example; doth it not hence follow, that their courſe is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, and diſloiall, and odious both in the ſight of God, and of man, and that not in thrée points, but in many points, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting partly of their impieties and errors in religion, and partly of their malcontent humours in ciuill actions? It is moſt apparent. For this Warder their good friend hath laide thoſe grounds, whereof this concluſion ariſeth.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then I ſay, that no papiſt ſince her Maieſties raigne hath ſuffred death, or loſſe of landes, or liberty méerely for his conſcience, vnleſſe he make it conſcience, not to commit trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Let the recordes be ſought, and their cauſes be examined, and this will eaſily appeare. And albeit ſome haue béene im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, yet was the ſame not directly for not comming to church, but for refuſing to pay the mulct.</p>
                     <p>Secondly compare their penalties and ſufferinges with the ſufferings of true Chriſtians, whome they impriſon, ſpoile, torture and murder, and that onely for matters of faith; and then they will appeare nothing in compariſon. But were they much greater, then they are; yet it is the cauſe, and not the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering that maketh their patience commendable.

                     <p>Thirdly I deny, that they haue ſhewed their duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. Nay in refuſing to heare his word, and to receiue the ſacraments ordeined and inſtituted by Chriſt Ieſus, and adminiſtred according to his holy inſtitution, and embracing a fond and falſe religion ſtanding partly on traditions and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh decretalles, and partly vpon leud cuſtomes and lying le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendes, and partly vpon wicked hereſies and falſe poſitions, they haue declared themſelues impious towardes God, and aliens from Chriſt his church. And that they ſhall well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:177777:101" rendition="simple:additions"/> by a ſpeciall encounter concerning that point.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly it is méere impudence, to affirme that the recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantes haue offered to her Maieſtie all loyall obedience in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall cauſes; or that they haue acknowledged her to be their liege prince. For who knoweth not, that the rebellions both in the north parts of England, and alſo in Ireland were rayſed by recuſants and papiſts? The ſame men haue diuers times attempted the deſtruction of her Maieſtie and the alteration of gouernment, as appeareth by the practiſes of <hi>Parry, Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, Throgmorton, Ch. Paget</hi> and others. Theſe are the men, that Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> hoped would ioyne with the Spanyard, and helpe to depoſe her Maieſtie. And although now they ſtir not; yet it appeareth, that their<note n="a" place="margin">Thoſe be the words of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians facultie.</note> obedience muſt onely conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, <hi>Rebus ſic ſtantibus.</hi> And call you this yéelding of loyall obedience? Beſide that the<note n="b" place="margin">Bulla Pij Quinti.</note> pope curſeth all that will obey her, or repute her as lawfull Quéene. Whether is it then more likely, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they will obey the popes ſentences, whom they take to be their ſoueraigne iudge in theſe caſes, or her Maieſties commaund, which they reſpect not? But ſuppoſe they would yéelde loyall obedience in temporall cauſes; yet that is not ſufficient to make the recuſantes ſeeme loyall ſubiectes. For the princes authority in commaunding for true faith, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing errors and abuſes, for eſtabliſhing externall orders, &amp; remoouing diſorders both in the time of the law, and in the auncient Chriſtian church, hath alwayes béene eſtéemed great.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly I would aduiſe theſe cacolike malecontentes, or recuſantes, or what you will haue them called, not to bragge too much of their good works, leaſt they giue others iuſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make their vncharitable dealing, and diſhoneſt liuing knowne. Now I will onely ſay this, that he that fauoureth forraine enemies, and entertaineth eyther practiſe or intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with them, or receiueth markes of faction from them; whatſoeuer his pretenſes are, cannot ſéeme much to edifie his neighbors. Surely he leaueth for himſelfe no place in the ſtate, that loueth not the ſtate. Let them therefore if they will néedes boaſt of their workes giue no more eare to theſe hiſpaniolized Engliſh, combined with traytors for the deſtruction of the country. For he canne hardly ſéeme honeſt, whome ſuch rine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued traytors, ſo highly do praiſe.</p>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:177777:101"/>
                     <p>In the end of this chapter he goeth about to teach his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples the recuſantes, how farre they are to yéelde obedience to their prince. But if his teaching be no better in ſchooles, then in theſe encounters, I doubt, he will make but few good ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Firſt he doth not ſhew vs, whome he taketh for a lawfull prince, which for determination of this controuerſie would certainly be knowne. For if he do not beléeue that a prince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate by the pope, and by him depoſed, is to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted lawfull, and to be obeyed, notwithſtanding the popes ſpite, then whatſoeuer he talketh here of obedience to princes, concerneth her Maieſtie nothing.</p>

                           <hi>P.</hi> 88.</note>Secondly he would haue recuſantes to ſerue their prince <hi>With body, goods, and life.</hi> Where we are to note, that he neither mentioneth the heart nor the inward affection. Do we not then thinke, that the recuſantes will do her Maieſtie good ſeruice, that are deliuered vnto her without ſoule, hart, or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affection?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly leaſt vpon his promiſe they might perhaps be too forward in ſeruice, he draweth them backe with a limitation, and teacheth, that their ſeruice and obedience is to ſtretch no further, <hi>Then to iuſt cauſes,</hi> of which he maketh eyther the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſantes themſelues, or the pope their holy father to be iudge. So that her Maieſtie, if the pope procéede againſt her, is to looke for no ſeruice at the recuſantes handes. Nay <hi>Allen</hi> in his traytorous exhortation to the nobility and people of England and Ireland hopeth to draw them to aſſiſte forreine enemies againſt her. Behould I pray you this goodly doctrine. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> he teacheth, <hi>That Chriſtian princes haue no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, nor authority in eccleſiaſticall cauſes, then heathen magiſtrates; for that Chriſt altered nothing at all in temporall gouernement.</hi> But that is a poſition contrary to the law of God, to the practiſe of Gods church, and moſt abſurd, &amp; ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. The law of God referreth ambiguous matters aſwell to the iudge or prince, as to the prieſts or leuites. For in the Sanedrin, of which that law is the foundation, the ſoueraine magiſtrate was chiefe;<note n="b" place="margin">
                           <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.</note> and the king was commanded <hi>To read in the law,</hi> that he might kéepe it, by his authority reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning offendors. In auncient time vnder the law the kinges and ſoueraigne magiſtrates gaue lawes to prieſts &amp; leuites, and not contrarywiſe. In the church of Chriſt for a thouſand
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:177777:102"/> yéeres or more there were no lawes obſerued, but thoſe of princes. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would fetch it higher, but his proofes faile him. In their Bullary which containeth a ſumme of the popes lawes, they begin with <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſeuenth. but in truth <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ninth was the firſt, that gaue authoritie of lawe to the popes conſtitutions, and gathered them into the booke of decretals.

                        <hi>Charles</hi> the great, <hi>Ludouicus Pius</hi> and diuers others. And certes very abſurd it were, if heathen princes, that are ſtrangers from Gods church ſhoulde haue as much authoritie, as Chriſtian magiſtrates, that are principall parts thereof, and to whom the execution of Gods law is committed. Neither is it mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, that Chriſt altered nothing in the office of magiſtrates. for it did alwaies belong to the magiſtrate, that was of the church, to gouerne the church in externall matters, and to ſée true doctrine publiſhed, and the ſacraments ſincerely admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by thoſe, to whoſe office it appertained. So we ſée, that by this falſe poſition he would exclude her Maieſtie from all gouernement in eccleſiaſticall cauſes, and that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his pretence of teaching obedience, he teacheth flat diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to princes eccleſiaſticall lawes, and their commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly he<note n="c" place="margin">
                           <hi>P.</hi> 88.</note> teacheth, <hi>That eccleſiaſticall and temporall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment is ſo diſtinguiſhed, that he that ruleth in the one ought not to rule in the other.</hi> The which doth vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the popes temporall kingdome, which our aduerſary would ſo willingly maintaine. For why ſhould he gouerne a kingdome, pretending to be a biſhop, rather then a king go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne a particular church of one nation, in externall cauſes eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially? Secondly we do deny this diſtinction of authority, vpon which our aduerſaries fancies are founded. And our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, for that in Chriſtian common wealthes, where the ſame perſons are members both of the church and common-welth, there the chéefe gouernours ought to haue care both of church and common-welth: and moſt abſurd it were, if the prince, which is a principall member of Gods church, ſhoulde haue no gouernment therein; and that inferior per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:177777:102" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhoulde haue ſupreme command ouer the prince.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly hée doth inſinuate, that the pope is Chriſts vicar, &amp; the apoſtles ſucceſſor in ſupreme gouernment of the church. And this hée teacheth is Recuſant ſchollers, leaſt percaſe they ſhoulde faile to obey him. But this is nothing elſe, but to draw her Maieſties ſubiects from their due allegiance, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to liſten to the pope, as pretending to bée Chriſts vicar, and the apoſtles ſucceſſor, and ſupreme gouernour and head of the vniuerſall church of Chriſt: which is quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to his faire pretenſes, and purpoſe in this place, where hee ſhoulde perſwade the Recuſants to obedience towarde their prince. Beſide that, it is ſo falſe, as nothing more. Let this Noddy, if he canne, ſhew foorth the popes commiſſion eyther for his vicegerentſhip, or for his pretended apoſtolicke office, and ſupreme gouernement. let him prooue it vnto vs, or elſe forbeare impudently to aſſume it, and to affirme it. wée doe ſhew, that biſhops are the apoſtles ſucceſſors. and yet that is no preiudice to the princes ſupreme authority, nor neuer was. What then is that which hée bableth of the pope, that is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther biſhop, nor the apoſtles ſucceſſor?</p>
                     <p>Finally hée affirmeth, <hi>That eccleſiaſticall gouernment ſtood diſtinct from ciuill 300. yeeres after Chriſt, and that euery emperour, and mortall prince conuerted to the faith, and entring into the church ſubmitted themſelues to this ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall gouernment, and ſo continued, vntill certaine he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes confounded all.</hi> And ſo ſtill cunningly hée ſpeaketh for the popes authoritie, and ſecretly diſableth not onely her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties power in eccleſiaſticall matters, but her title alſo to the crowne, ſtanding as ſhée doth excommunicate by the pope. He doth alſo abuſe his reader with the ambiguitie of eccleſiaſticall gouernment. For if by eccleſiaſticall gouernment he meaneth the power of the keies conſiſting in the cenſures of the church, and power of prieſtly function, which is properly eccleſiaſtical, we grant that ſuch eccleſiaſtical gouernment belongeth not to princes, ſo that they are to execute the ſame in their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But if by eccleſiaſticall gouernment he meane power to direct, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand in externall matters; and to cauſe euery eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical perſon to do his function; and to ſée the church, &amp; euery part thereof well ordred, and abuſes reformed; it is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that ſuch gouernment appertaineth to princes, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:177777:103"/> euer did both before Chriſts time, and after, and that no pope of Rome did euer meddle with any ſuch matters before <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> the ſeuenth, or <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ninth his time, as before hath béene declared; and ſhall againſt ſtronger aduerſaries, then this ſéely Noddy bée iuſtified. Laſtly they were no here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, that giue to the prince this authoritie, but thoſe rather that giue power to popes to depoſe princes and diſcharge their ſubiects from their othes of allegiance: as <hi>Sigebertus Gem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blacenſis</hi> ſpeaking of the trecherous dealing of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſeuenth againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, in expreſſe terms affirmeth, and the Synode at Brixina aſſembled againſt <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſeuenth determineth,</p>
                     <p>And thus wée ſee that this Noddy contrary to his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath intricated himſelfe and his clients the Recuſants in this cauſe. Before this many men woulde haue thought, that hee and his friendes the Recuſants had béene of a better mind to her Maieſtie, and this ſtate. But now all the worlde may ſée their whole purpoſe and intention verified by their owne maſters doctrine, and authoritie. They ſerue the prince, but not with hartie affection, nor in all cauſes, nor againſt euerie enimie. They yéeld her no authoritie in eccleſiaſticall cauſes; nay they giue it cléere away to the pope. Finally they make her ſubiect, not onely to the popes excommunication, but alſo to his ſentence concerning her crowne and kingdome. So it appéereth by their owne confeſſion, that they are but ſory ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects; and when the pope hath once gotten a ſide héere, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent enimies. The ſame doth alſo appéere by their rebellions and practiſes againſt her Maieſtie and the ſtate, and by their infamous libels ſet out by the pope, by <hi>Sanders, Allen, Ribal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineira, Riſhton,</hi> and diuers traytors, which the Recuſantes either approoue, or do not diſallow; and laſtly by the generall hatred, that papiſts beare both againſt true religion, and alſo againſt all that maintaine it, or profeſſe it. Wherefore albeit I do not wiſh the puniſhments of papiſts aggrauated; yet I ſay, it is great weakneſſe in vs, either to ſuffer their inſolency, or not to ſecure our ſelues againſt their hatred and tyrannie. But I need not vſe many words to ſtir vp the magiſtrates to vigilancie. They ſee theſe things, and I doubt not, will take a courſe not ſtill to ſuffer their right to bée diſputed, or their actions diſgraced and ſlandered: and euery true patriot, I
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:177777:103"/> hope, I will concurre with their prince, and not ſuffer the bowels of their countrey any longer by theſe vipers to bée gnawed. The trecherous intention of this our aduerſarie, I haue opened; ſo that I hope, the quieter ſort of Recuſantes will not much truſt him; his malice againſt true religion is euery where apparent, ſo that, I truſt, honeſt men will héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after learne to deteſt him, and to prouide more carefullie againſt him, and his conſorts. And ſo I diſmiſſe him for this turne, as a falſe traytor; you may looke to his procéedings, if you pleaſe, as a falſe teacher.</p>

But when I ſaw, that all this furie grew vpon ſome wordes vttred partly againſt the pope of Rome, that is neither lawfull prince, nor potentate, nor honeſt man; but onely a greaſie prieſt or frier, if ſo much; and partly againſt the Spaniard, who to ſerue the popes pleaſure without deſert of ours is become our enimie; then I perceiued it was nothing elſe, but a loftie tricke of iacke an apes, that for feare of the whip leaped out of his little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

                     <p>Firſt it gréeueth him excéedingly to heare, that the pope ſhould be called <hi>The man of ſinne, and that Antichriſt,</hi> of whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apoſtle 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2 ſpeaketh. And ſome reaſon he hath, in regard of his owne particular, to be offended. For if the pope be Antichriſt, then is our aduerſary a marked ſlaue of Antichriſt, a falſe prophet, and an inſtrument of ſatan. But how heinouſly the matter is taken, it is not greatly materiall; that the pope is very Antichriſt, we make no queſtion: neither ſhould any doubt, if they would well conſider his procéedings. For firſt the name of Antichriſt importeth, that taking the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and place of Chriſt he ſhould notwithſtanding ſet him ſelfe againſt Chriſt. Secondly the office of Antichriſt is to ſet himſelfe againſt Chriſt his kingdome. Thirdly he ſhall excell in pride and arrogancy, and take to himſelfe diuine honors. Fourthly notwithſtanding his pretence of holineſſe, yet ſhall he excell in all impiety and wickedneſſe. Fiftly he ſhall haue a face of braſſe, and pretend vnderſtanding of all doubtes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Sixtly he ſhall appeare vpon the decay of the Romayne empire. Seuenthly he ſhall riſe out of the ruines of that ſtate.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Hée ſhall cauſe a great apoſtacie from the Chriſtian faith, and in his raigne there ſhall bee a generall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mens manners. 9. Although his kingdome ſhall be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to Chriſtes kingdome, yet ſhall he ſit in Gods church, and take on him the authority of the church. 10. The ſeate of his empire ſhal be in Rome. 11. His kingdome is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the purple whoore <hi>Apocalip.</hi> 17. and by Babylon <hi>Apocalip.</hi> 18. 12. Antichriſt his impietie ſhall bée hidden and myſticall. 13. Hée ſhall moſt gréeuouſly afflicte Chriſt his church. 14. He ſhall rule in mens conſciences.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. He ſhall make merchandiſe of mens ſoules.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Hée ſhall bee like a lambe, and yet ſpeake like the Dragon. 17. Hée ſhall take to himſelfe the power of the Romayne Empire. 18. Hée ſhall bring in a newe

                     <p n="20">20. Hée ſhall in effect denie Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. Hée ſhall pretend to worke wonders, and the worlde ſhall beléeue his ſignes and wonders. 22. He ſhall preſcribe a certaine forme of ceremonies &amp; lawes to all his folowers. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally he ſhall riſe obſcurely, receiue power of princes, encreaſe by force, be folowed with all wicked traytors, heretikes, athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtes, and ſhall be deſtroyed with the breath of Gods ſpirite. All which conditions, as they are proper and well agrée to the pope of Rome, and his kingdome; ſo the aduerſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues cannot ſhew any other, vnto whome theſe qualities canne agree. He calleth himſelfe Chriſts vicar, and yet oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelfe againſt Chriſt and his kingdome. He declareth himſelfe a plaine aduerſary in ſuppreſſing Gods word, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling his owne conſtitutions, and aduancing himſelfe aboue all, that is called God. He taketh to himſelfe the name, power and honor, that is proper to God, excelling all mortall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in pride and arrogancy. His life is full of all abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He taketh no ſhame, albeit his dooings be moſt ſhamefull, nay albeit his ignorance in religion be excéeding great, yet doth he vant himſelfe, that he cannot erre in decyding of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith. Preſently vpon the decay of the Romayne em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, his kingdome beganne to ſhew it ſelfe. Neyther did he riſe, but vpon the ruines of that ſtate. Hauing gotten credite among Chriſtians, he brought in infinite nouelties into reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and by his euill example, and facilitie in granting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons wrought a great diſſolution in mens manners. At Rome hée now reigneth and none but hée. Nay hée is reputed to bée head of the church although head of the ſocietie of wicked and feined Chriſtians. His kingdome is plainly deſcribed in the figure of the purple whoore and of Babylon. Finally his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall impieties, perſecutions of Chriſtians, merchandizing of mens ſoules, and all thoſe properties of antichriſt, which before I deſcribed, appéering in him, and in no other, declare him to bée antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>Neither can any medicine, which the papiſts haue deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, helpe this gréefe. As for the Noddy our aduerſarie, hée doth not vnderſtand thoſe reaſons which hée draweth out of <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Much leſſe is hée able to enforce them. Firſt hée
<pb facs="tcp:177777:105"/> telleth vs <hi>That antichriſt ſhall be one ſinguler man.</hi> But that cannot ſtande with the apoſtles wordes, that teacheth vs that the myſterie of iniquitie began to worke in his time. Againe the kingdome of Antichriſt could not bée erected, &amp; attaine to ſuch greatnes by one man onely; nor is one onely man oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to Chriſt. Further the ſtate of antichriſts kingdome is called an apoſtacie, but the terme of apoſtacie cannot fit one man. Finally Saint<note n="a" place="margin">1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, that that antichriſt that was prophecied of, was in the world in his time. And<note n="b" place="margin">Tract. <hi>30.</hi> in Matthaeum.</note> 
                        <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene</hi> maketh antichriſt a ſtate or ſucceſſion of men. <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter</hi> ſaith hée, <hi>vnus antichriſtus eſt, ſpecies autem eius multae.</hi> Neither haue the Scriptures or fathers any thing, whereof the contrarie may directly be concluded. Onely the ſcriptures by the figure of one beaſt do ſet out a ſtate, and the fathers do firmely adhere to the manner of ſpéech vſed in Scripture, which by one particular man vnderſtand diuers men ſuccée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in one ſtate.

                     <p>Secondly he ſaith, <hi>That the Iewes ſhall receiue Antichriſt for their Meſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> 
                        <hi>Nonnus</hi> expound it. And if we ſhould otherwiſe take it, then would it folow, that Antichriſt ſhould come in the apoſtles times, that he might be receiued of thoſe, to whome our ſauiour then ſpoke.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly he reaſoneth out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. and 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. <hi>That the goſpel of Chriſt muſt firſt be preached to all nations, before the comming of Antichriſt: which</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is not yet fulfilled.</hi> But in the 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. there is no mention made of preaching the Goſpell to all nations. In the 24. of <hi>Matthew</hi> wée finde, that the preaching of the Goſpell to all nations ſhall bée ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled before Chriſts ſecond comming, and not before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Antichriſt. But were this a ſigne of the comming of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:177777:105"/> antichriſt, yet it is long, ſince the ſound of the Goſpell hath paſſed throughout the world.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>That antichriſt ſhould be a Iewe, and of the tribe of Dan;</hi> is but a méere conceite of ſome few, vpon falſe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſcripture: for how ſhall a Iewe, that eſtabliſheth the ceremoniall law of <hi>Moſes</hi> bée receiued among Chriſtians? Wherefore this notwithſtanding, the pope may bée anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly it is a Iewiſh fancie <hi>That antichriſt ſhall reigne in Hieruſalem, and reſtore Salomons Temple.</hi> Neither is anie ſuch matter gathered out of the eleuenth chapter of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe, where it is ſaide, not that the bodies of <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Helias,</hi> as this falſarie hath, but <hi>That the bodies of the two prophets ſhall lie in the ſtreetes of the great citie.</hi> For he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of the perſecution by antichriſt, but by the Gentiles, and vnderſtandeth all godly men, that ſhall beare witneſſe of the truth of Chriſt Ieſus.<note n="a" place="margin">Lib. <hi>18.</hi> in Iſai. &amp; ad Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſ. q. <hi>11.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, that all theſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of reſtoring the citie, and temple &amp; ceremonies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede from the hereſie of <hi>Cerinthus.</hi> And truely very ſtrange it were, if antichriſtes reigne continuing but thrée yéeres and a halfe, as our aduerſaries hold, hée ſhoulde reedifie the citie and the temple, and founde ſo large a kingdome, as that of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhall bée.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly it cannot bée prooued, <hi>That antichriſt ſhall expreſly deny Ieſus, and vtterly aboliſh the ſacraments inſtituted by Chriſt, and openly profeſſe, that either hee is Meſſias, or God himſelfe.</hi> Neither in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 1. of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 22. nor <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. nor 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. which places are cited to this purpoſe, is any ſuch thing to be founde. Nay his dooings they ſhall bée myſticall, and hée ſhall deceiue many. But if hée ſhoulde plainly denie Chriſt, and aboliſh his Sacraments, he coulde not deceiue any Chriſtian. Saint<note n="b" place="margin">In Ioan. Tract. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Auguſtine</hi> therefore calleth them antichriſts, <hi>That by their workes denie Chriſt.</hi> And cunningly ſhall antichriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the Sacraments, and take to himſelfe diuine worſhip. All which wée ſée verified by the pope: and therefore rightly take him to be antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, that antichriſt ſhall worke lying miracles, it is not denied. For it is very apparent, that popiſh religion doth much ſtande vpon miracles; and the legendes red in chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are full of them. But that hee ſhall make fire come really
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:177777:106"/> and viſiblie downe from heauen, or make a dumbe image ſpeake it is no where declared or prooued. Neither is it a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle for a man to feine himſelfe dead, and to riſe againe. For that euery ſacrificing prieſt is able to do that, albeit his power to worke miracles bée not great. By fire therefore, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhal make to come from heauen, we are to vnderſtand antichriſtes thundring excommunications and other ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the wrath of the court of heauen, that hée ſéemeth to haue at his diſpoſition. By the image of the beaſt <hi>Apocal.</hi> 13. wée are to vnderſtande new Rome, which now giueth out her imperiall edicts; by the beaſt that had a mortall wounde and yet was after a ſort cured wée vnderſtand the Romaine em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire after a ſort reſtored in the papacie. And ſo all agréeth with the pope and his kingdome, and ſheweth him to bée anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Wée do alſo read, <hi>That antichriſt ſhall reigne two times, one time, and a halfe.</hi> But that this number is to bée taken preciſely for thrée yéeres and a halfe, and no more, wée do not read, nor beléeue. For as this time is applied to antichriſtes reigne, ſo likewiſe is the time of 42. monethes, and 1290. daies, neither of which numbers doth preciſely make thrée yéeres and a halfe. Moreouer it is a vaine imagination to thinke, that ſuch an alteration, as antichriſt will make, can be wrought in three yéeres and a halfe.</p>
                     <p>Further the doctrine of napiſtes concerning the comming againe of <hi>Helias,</hi> is nothing but a Iewiſh fable, as appéereth by the wordes of the apoſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. <hi>Why do the Scribes ſay,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that Helias muſt firſt come?</hi> Our Sauiour alſo declareth, that <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> was figured by <hi>Helias</hi> after a ſort. Their opinion concerning <hi>Henochs</hi> returne is alſo a méere fiction. for neither in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> chap. 11. nor in the 48. chap. of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> which is all the ground our aduerſaries haue to prooue theſe matters, is there any apparance, that hée ſhall come againe, and bée ſlaine of antichriſt. So that if the papiſtes looke not for antichriſtes comming before they heare of <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Helias,</hi> they are like to bée much abuſed. And as well may the old Britons looke for the returne of king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur;</hi> as they for <hi>Henoch</hi> and <hi>Helias.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly our aduerſary dreameth, when he beléeueth, that within fiue and fortie daies after Antichriſtes death, Chriſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:177777:106"/> ſhall make an end of the world, and come to iudgement. For if that were true, then ſhould not the end of the world come vpon ſuch a ſuddaine, as<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.</note> Chriſt telleth, nor ſhould the ſame be kept from mens knowledge, as he likewiſe teacheth, that it ſhall. Wherefore if the Noddy haue no better meanes to ſhift off the name of Antichriſt from the pope, then by determining the preciſe time of Chriſtes ſecond comming; then the pope will aſſuredlie prooue Antichriſt. For that time no mortall man knoweth, or can certainly know.</p>
                     <p>Now if the pope be Antichriſt, it is to no purpoſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, whether he be one of Antichriſtes forerunners. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Noddy will néedes for his owne pleaſure diſpute that queſtion, it will not be amiſſe, for a fuller view of the mans folly, to conſider likewiſe of this his fooliſh diſpute. Firſt to prooue that Antichriſt hath his forerunners, he alleadgeth a place out of<note n="b" place="margin">1. <hi>Iob.</hi> 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Iohn,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>You haue heard how Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt commeth, and how many are become antichriſtes.</hi> But this prooueth, that antichriſt was rather then come. and ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> affirmeth ſaying, <hi>That he was then in the world.</hi> Which ouerthroweth the Noddies conceit of forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſheweth that hée is runne out of breath, and out of his wit; and yet helpeth him nothing to ſhew, that the pope of Rome is not antichriſt. for albeit the biſhops of Rome were not antichriſts in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> time: yet later popes of Rome furthering the myſterie of iniquitie, that began couertly to worke in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> time, appéered plainly to bée antichriſt, and in them antichriſt, that before did worke cloſely, and in diuers men, and diuers places, became openly to be knowne, and reuealed. Hée ſaith further, that <hi>Turkes, Mores, tyrants, perſecuters and other wicked people, and eſpecially heretikes and ſectaries are forerunners of antichriſt.</hi> But if this were ſo, then might the pope alſo bée a forerunner of antichriſt, for any thing this proctor of antichriſt can alleage to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſurpaſſing all others in wickedneſſe, and being the father and author of diuers hereſies, of which wée ſhall haue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeake more héereafter. And indéede ſéeing antichriſt was long in the worlde, before hée obteined his kingdome; and that thoſe, that laide the foundation of his ſtate, went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the popes, that openly reigned; it is not ſtrange to ſay, that ſome popes were, as it were, pages and forerunners,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:177777:107"/> and workers of antichriſtes apoſtacie; and that at the length other popes began to ſhewe themſelues manifeſtly in his ſeat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For if new Rome figured by the whoore of Babylon <hi>Apocal.</hi> 17. bée the ſeate of antichriſt, and if his kingdome bée the weſterne Babylon; then doth the apoſtle plainly declare, that the pope is anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. For none hath reigned there of long time, but the pope of Rome. But that the ſtate of new Rome, as it is the ſeate of the pope, is figured by the purple whoore <hi>Apocal.</hi> 17 and by Babylon, it is prooued<note n="b" place="margin">Matth. Sutl. de pontif. Rom. lib. <hi>5.</hi>
                        </note> already by reaſons vnanſwerable.

And therefore no reaſon, that we ſhould ſuppoſe hée declared the flouriſhing eſtate of the ſame empire in the 17. chap. which were nothing but to go backe, &amp; foorth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly immediately after the deſtruction of Babylon and the purple whoore, the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh of the mariage of the lambe, and of the laſt iudgement, which muſt enſue after the deſtruction of Babylon, &amp; the purple whoore immediately. Of which wée may gather, that the popes kingdome, and not the Romaine empire, that is long ſince deſtroied is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the purple whoore, and by Babylon.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth vs, that the beaſt whereupon the purple whoore did ſit, was to aſcend out of the bottomeleſſe pit, and was not yet in the world.

For the pope this allegation is moſt fond and ſenceleſſe. For it canne neuer be prooued, that the popes tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall gouernement both in church and common wealth is of God. Let any learned papiſt (for our aduerſary is but a ſéely Noddy) ſhew, that the popes gouernement and fulneſſe of power, which he claimeth ouer all churches, is of God.

For theſe wordes were deliuered to the ſeuentie diſciples, and not to the twelue. Beſide, were theſe wordes to be vnderſtood of the apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors, yet they concerne the pope nothing. For he is no apoſtle, béeing neither called immediately of God, nor ſent into al the world, nor ledde into all truth, nor being able to make his decretals of authenticall credite. Hée is not the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſucceſſor: for hée féedeth not, nor preacheth, nor doth anie part of apoſtolicall function. Nay hee doth contrary to the apoſtles faſhion, murder Gods ſaints, trouble Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and reſiſt Chriſtes doctrine. The apoſtles taught ſuch things, as Chriſt gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in inſtructions. The popes publiſh nothing, but fond decretals, and ſtrange doctrine not onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, but alſo in manie points contrarie to Chriſtes Goſpell and holy Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>But ſaith <hi>N. D. The biſhops of Rome be ſucceſſors in the apoſtle Saint Peters ſeat.</hi> Which I do not altogether deny, if he meane the firſt biſhops of Rome, which were indéede true biſhops, and ſuccéeded <hi>Peter</hi> and other apoſtles teaching apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall doctrine. So all other true and godly biſhops alſo were ſucceſſors of <hi>Peter:</hi> albeit they claymed not this vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality and fulneſſe of power, which the pope pretendeth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him. But whatſoeuer the firſt biſhops of Rome were, yet this concerneth the pope nothing, for he is no biſhop, nor teacher, nor ſucceſſor in <hi>Peters</hi> chaire, but rather <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> his ſucceſſor buing and ſelling not onely ſacraments, and benefices, but alſo mens ſoules. He ſuccéedeth alſo the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks in worſhipping angels, the Carpocratians in diſſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and worſhipping images, the Collyridians in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Manichées in his halfe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and forbidding of mariage to prieſts, the Pelagians in extolling the force of nature and merit of works, and infinite
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:177777:109"/> other heretickes in ſeuerall points of leud doctrine. He ſuccée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth alſo <hi>Nero</hi> in the Empire of Rome, rather then <hi>Peter,</hi> that was ſubiect to <hi>Neroes</hi> gouernement.</p>
                     <p>He alleadgeth alſo the example of the ſcribes and phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſées, and ſaith <hi>That Chriſt commaunded his diſciples to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and do, whatſoeuer the ſcribes and phariſees, that ſate in Moſes chayre, ſaid to them.</hi> And to ſpeake truth, he hath more reaſon to compare the pope to ſcribes and phariſers corrupters of the law, then to the ſucceſſors of Chriſtes Apoſtles. But yet will not this ſerue his purpoſe: for our Sauiors meaning was to ſhew, that ſuch as ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeat, and taught his law were to be heard, albeit otherwiſe bad men. But the popes do not ſit in <hi>Peters</hi> ſeat, nor in <hi>Moſes</hi> chaire, nor teach apoſtolicall or true doctrine.</p>
                     <p>Hée telleth vs further, <hi>That railers ſhall not inherite Chriſtes kingdome, eſpecially ſuch, as raile againſt Magiſtrates.</hi> All which wee admitte.

Neither doth this concerne the pope, that is neither Magiſtrate, nor good Chriſtian. For that which this Noddy writeth, <hi>How the pope is a ſpirituall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and hath a higher degree of authoritie then temporall magiſtrates, and that he doth repreſent immediately the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> is nothing but a péece of his frierlike folly, and ignorance in ſpirituall and temporall matters. For if ſuch high authoritie had béene giuen him, no doubt, but wée
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:177777:110"/> ſhoulde long ere this haue ſéene authenticall writings of this donation, and haue heard of the particulars. Now wée muſt take theſe words, as procéeding from a writer of antichriſtes marke, that for Chriſt woulde commend vnto vs antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>He telleth vs, <hi>That all ancient diuines and doctors for aboue a thouſand yeeres togither haue taught, that it is blaſphemie to raile at the biſhop of Rome appointed by Chriſt to gouerne in his place, and damnation not to acknowledge his authoritie.</hi> And yet he is not able to ſhew either one ſound diuine or doctor that hath ſo taught. Nay he is not able to name many canoniſtes, no nor ſchoolemen, that haue ſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or ſpoken. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi>

But the pope is neither God, nor ſaint. Nay if it bée blaſphemy to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to man that which is proper to God, as the foreſaide ſchoolemen teach, then do the papiſts blaſpheme, that giue to the pope Chriſts power to remit ſins, &amp; ſticke not to call him a god on earth. All ancient fathers of the church had the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome in no other eſtéeme, then they had other godlie biſhops; neither did euer any one ſuppoſe, that it was dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation not to acknowledge his authoritie. Nay his vniuerſall authoritie ouer all the church, and infinite power in depoſing princes, not <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> but all ancient writers doe gainſay and denie. So that vnleſſe the Reader haue great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in this place, hée will hardly endure to read ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and notorious lies. I cannot chooſe but woonder, that he is ſo lauiſh in talking of the popes authoritie without offring his Reader any proofe or reaſon of his ſayings.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> haue ſpoken againſt the popes authoritie, therefore doth our aduerſarie in a furious rage of railing call the firſt <hi>A looſe apoſtate frier,</hi> and the ſecond, <hi>A ſearbackt prieſt for Sodomie.</hi> As if it were lawfull to raile &amp; reuell againſt any, but the pope and his darlings; and as if his declamation againſt railers did not touch himſelfe. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere therefore, that as it is lawfull to reprooue publike of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders publikely, and to publiſh the abominations of the whoore of Babylon to the worlde; ſo none but ſuch, as haue whooriſh foreheads, thinke it lawfull to publiſh notorious
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:177777:110"/> ſlanders againſt innocent men. As for <hi>Luther,</hi> his innocencie was ſuch, that he gaue the aduerſarie no iuſt cauſe of euill ſpeaking. And therefore they call him looſe, becauſe hée was matched in honeſt mariage, themſelues being giuen to all viciouſneſſe of liuing and looſeneſſe. Nay albeit themſelues be friers, yet they are ſtill rayling at him, for that once hée had beene a frier. <hi>Caluin</hi> was neuer maſſe prieſt, and yet the prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> obiect prieſthood to him. He liued without ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion of incontinencie, and yet are they not aſhamed to charge him with moſt vnnaturall and abominable filthineſſe, and ſay he was puniſhed for it. But the author of this ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Bolſecus</hi> in an open ſynode did confeſſe with teares, that without ground he had ſlandred him, and the very narration it ſelfe is ſo improbable, that any man may ſée it was deuiſed by a ſot, ſuborned to raile vpon <hi>Caluin,</hi> &amp; moſt abſurdly forged againſt ſo innocent a man. Let it be prooued, that ſuch a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is due for ſuch an offence, and that <hi>Caluin</hi> at Noyon was ſo puniſhed; and then we will confeſſe, that they haue reaſon to raile againſt him.

For in diſallowing the popes tyrannicall gouernment, we do not depend on two or thrée new doctors, no nor on two thouſand, but vpon the authoritie of the apoſtles and apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church, and all ancient fathers of the church. We finde it contrarie to the gouernment of the church vnder the lawe, to apoſtolike rules, to the ancient canons of Chriſts church. If then we will rightly iudge, popiſh doctrine is better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to this poiſoned herbe, then ours: and the popiſh ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and canoniſtes are the new phyſicions, of which this Noddy ſpeaketh.

                     <p>We ſaie further, that all thoſe reaſons which this Noddy bringeth to prooue this noble and famous kingdome of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:177777:111"/> pope, vpon which the papiſts do builde all their hope, as the Iewes do vpon the expectation of the terreſtriall kingdome of their Meſſias, bée nothing elſe but idle fancies of an addle head diſtempered with affection to the pope, and hatred to his prince.</p>

                           <hi>P.</hi> 97,</note> ſaith he, <hi>It cannot be imagined, but that Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted a church to continue, &amp; to be gouerned to the worlds end.</hi> Which is a very graue conſideration, and very déepe, continuing from Chriſtes time to the end of the world. But it maketh nothing for the popes gouernment, nor for his vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall monarchie. For God had his church from <hi>Adam:</hi> yet did he not inſtitute one vniuerſall head and gouernour like the pope, nor approoue any ſuch like gouernment, wherein one had all power, and bought and ſolde mens ſoules for money. But if Chriſt appointed, that his church ſhould continue, then is it not likely, that the papacie which tendeth to the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the church, and of all religion, came in by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Secondly he telleth vs, <hi>That this gouernement was to be vnder biſhops and prelates ordeined by the holy ghoſt by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of handes of the apoſtles, whoſe ſucceſſors they were; and that this ſucceſſion is to endure to the worldes end.</hi> But he had ſaid better, if he had determined that biſhops ſhould be vnder gouernement, rather then gouernement vnder biſhops. For that is beſt gouernement where gouernours are ſubiect to lawes, and not lawes to mens fancies, as it is in the popes gouernement, where all matters are referred to his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Further he had dealt more wiſely, if he had paſſed ouer in ſilence this ordination by the holy ghoſt, and ſucceſſion from the apoſtles. For if biſhops appointed by the holy ghoſt, and that haue right of ſucceſſion from the apoſtles be to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the church of God: then muſt the popes of Rome lay handes off, of this gouernement. For neither can they ſhew commiſſion from the holy ghoſt, nor right of ſucceſſion, and truth of doctrine from the apoſtles. Nay it appeareth they are rather wolues, then true biſhops and paſtors, and ſuccéede <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> rather in killing and murdering, then <hi>Peter</hi> in feeding and cheriſhing Chriſtes lambes.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:177777:112"/> ſucceſſors of <hi>Iames,</hi> nor <hi>Peter,</hi> that ſometime taught in thoſe places.</p>
                     <p>His third reaſon, as he ſaith, is drawne from the light of nature. <hi>For becauſe among the prelates of the church, Chriſt would haue ſome ſubordination for auoyding ſchiſme and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and becauſe all philoſophers held without controuerſie, that the monarchie was the beſt among all regiments, he ſaith it is very probable, euen by reaſon it ſelfe, that Chriſt inſtituted a monarchicall gouernement in his church.</hi> But firſt it is no ſmall error in matters of ſpirituall gouernement to draw a patterne from humane reaſon, that in ſpirituall matters is ſo blind, and from philoſophers, that vnderſtood nothing; and to ground faith vpon probabilities, and likelyhoods.<note n="a" place="margin">Lib <hi>2.</hi> de pontif.

                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath hitherto borne vs in hand, that Chriſt inſtituted the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy. But this wiſe Noddy layeth the foundation of it vpon probability, and humane reaſon. Secondly it is abſurd to thinke, that the ſame gouernement is beſt both for church, and common wealth. For the church is Chriſtes myſticall body, and hath her head in heauen, and is gouerned by diuine lawes. The common wealth is a politicall body, and hath her gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors preſent with her here in earth, and is gouerned by lawes of men. There all commaund commeth from heauen, here the moſt part commeth from men. Thirdly albeit Chriſt would haue a ſubordination of officers in church gouernement, yet maketh that nothing for the popes extrauagant power, but rather againſt it. For when Chriſt made his ſubordination, &amp;<note n="b" place="margin">
                           <hi>Epheſ</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</note> ſet out the liſt of the officers of the church, he gaue apoſtles, prophets, euangeliſtes, paſtors and doctors, not ſo much as mentioning the popes holineſſe, which could not haue béene doone, if the pope had bin conſtituted chiefe gouernor of Chriſt his church. Laſtly it is a bould and impudent vntruth to ſay, that all philoſophers held a monarchie to be the beſt forme of gouernment. This ſimple hoddy Noddie hath neither read all, nor many: and therefore cannot tell. But his fellowes could haue told him, and their writings declare, that <hi>Plato, Cicero, Philo, Ioſephus,</hi> &amp; diuers others condemne monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal gouernment: and that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> preferreth an ariſtocratical gouernment before a monarchicall. Nay <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe aboue all gouernments commendeth a forme mixed of diuers ſtates, and formes of common-welthes.</p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:177777:112"/>
                     <p>His fourth reaſon is very celeſtiall. for <hi>Becauſe God made Lucifer firſt head of the angels, and afterward head of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels;</hi> he beléeueth <hi>That one pope muſt neceſſarily be head of the catholike church.</hi> So his firſt reaſon for the papacie was from man and humane reaſon, the ſecond is from the diuell of hell, and his authoritie. Is it not likely to prooue a braue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, that hath ſo ſtrange a precedent? Beſide it is very vncertaine, whether God eſtabliſhed any ſuch gouernment among angels, as is ſuppoſed. Nay it is not likely, ſeeing Chriſt Ieſus is head of angels, and preſent with them, that they haue any head, but him. In the 40. of <hi>Iob,</hi> and 14. of <hi>Iſay</hi> there is no ſuch matter to bée founde, as our aduerſary pretendeth: nor doth Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> or any other father teach any ſuch doctrine. Mention is made of <hi>Michael</hi> and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels <hi>Apocal.</hi> 12. But that hée is head of all angels, cannot out of thoſe words be prooued. As for our aduerſaries themſelues, it is very vnlikely they ſhoulde know the oeconomy and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of angels in heauen, that will not ſée, what God hath ordeined concerning his church on earth.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly he affirmeth, <hi>That God eſtabliſhed a monarchicall gouernment in the church of the Iewes giuing them a high prieſt to direct all other prieſts, and al ſynagogues in the world.</hi> Wherein he bewraieth his great ignorance in matters of the people of God. For in that ſtate the chéefe authoritie for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters both eccleſiaſticall and ciuill was in the councell of ſtate, which they called <hi>Sanedrin,</hi> which was appointed by God himſelfe <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. and iudged all cauſes, and perſons, yea the high prieſt himſelfe. Afterward the chéefe commaund was in princes both concerning prieſtes, and other church matters. <hi>Salomon</hi> depoſed one high prieſt and placed another: all which maketh againſt the ſuppoſed gouernment of the chéefe prieſt. They that liſt to ſée theſe matters prooued out of Scriptures, &amp; writers of the hiſtories of that people, let them read <hi>M. Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffes</hi> treatiſe <hi>De Pontifice Rom. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5. 6. 7. 8.</p>
                     <p>His ſixt reaſon is drawne from the ſimilitude of riuers, trées and all creatures. But he is much deceiued, if he thinke all creatures to haue liked of monarchicall gouernement. All birdes haue not one head, no nor all beaſts, nor all trées. Could he ſhew me who is the head gouernour of all owles or wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cockes, he ſhould worke a wondrous feat for the eſtabliſhing
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:177777:113"/> of his holy fathers monarchie. If not, then his ſimilitudes will ſhew him to be a Noddy and a woodcocke. Which alſo appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in this, that there is great difference in things naturall and politicall, and that the papall gouernement is not like to thoſe naturall things, which he mentioneth.</p>
                     <p>His ſeuenth reaſon ſtandeth vpon this ground, <hi>That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a monarchie in the church, ſchiſme and diuiſion cannot be auoyded.</hi> But that is but a point of his folly and ignorance. For no doubt, but God prouided againſt ſchiſme, when he gaue chiefe authority to the councell of ſtate <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. And Chriſt prouided for the ſame likewiſe, when he choſe not one, but twelue apoſtles, and ſent them abroade into the world with one and the ſame commiſſion. As for the humane deuiſes of popes, they were neuer ſo ſufficient remedies againſt this ſuppoſed miſchiefe of ſchiſme, but that there hath fallen out among the popes ſome 22. or more ſchiſmes, and infinite ſects, and diuiſions among the members of the Romiſh ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all he ſaith, <hi>The church is compared to a well ordered army, that muſt neceſſarily haue a knowne generall: likewiſe to a houſe, a ſheepefould, a ſhip, the arke of Noe; all which things haue one head gouernour.</hi> But nothing is more preiudiciall to ſo great a gouernment, then that it ſhoulde reſt vpon ſo weake ſimilitudes, which prooue nothing, further then they haue confirmation out of the holy Scriptures, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence they are taken. For example out of theſe ſimilitudes wee may with better reaſon ouerthrow the papacie, then eſtabliſh it. For if euery houſhold, and ſhip, and ſhéepefold haue ſeuerall heads, and are not vnder one chéefe maſter of houſhold, or one principall ſhipmaſter, or ſhepheard; then is not this generall monarchie prooued by ſo weake ſimilitudes. We may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very well conclude out of the premiſſes, that all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the Warder with his multiplicity of wordes hath brought to prooue, that the gouernment of the church vniuerſall ought to be monarchicall, are miſhapen, euill fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, weake timbred, and vtterly inſufficient. Beſide all that we haue yet alleaged, we are to vnderſtand, that Chriſt is ſo the monarke of the church vniuerſall, that no other can be admitted in his place without iniurie to him. There is but one head of one body, one huſband of one wife, one chéefe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:177777:113"/> gouernor of one ſtate. As for the pope hée being no biſhop de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth no place in the gouernment of the church; and the firſt biſhops of Rome were but fellowes firſt with other biſhops, and afterward with other patriarkes.</p>
                     <p>So then it appéereth not, that the externall gouernment of the church was monarchicall. Neither do I thinke, that this Noddy will prooue, that <hi>Peter</hi> was the monarke or head of the church vnder Chriſt. His reaſons do hang togither like ropes of ſand. <hi>Chriſtes proceeding with Peter,</hi> ſaith hée, <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his meaning.</hi> But it appéereth not, that his meaning was to make him the monarke of the church. For albeit hée did that to <hi>Peter,</hi> that he did to none of the reſt of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, yet doth it not follow thereof, that he ment to giue him any ſuch priuilege or authoritie, as is pretended. For hée did that to <hi>Iudas</hi> and to the ſonnes of <hi>Zebedei,</hi> that hée did not to any other apoſtle. <hi>Iudas</hi> was made treaſurer; yet was he not made a monarke of the worlde, although the purſe doth work much in ſuch caſes. He ſaith further, <hi>That Chriſt firſt reueiled to Peter the hidden myſtery of the incarnation, and of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinitie, and that he ſaid onely to him, Rogaui prote, ne deficiat fides tua.</hi> And, <hi>That he promiſed to him, that the gates of hell ſhoulde neuer preuaile againſt his ſeate.</hi> And ſheweth, <hi>How Chriſt paide tribute onely for Peter, and for himſelfe, and changed Peters name, and did myracles in Peters ſhippe, and how Peter walked on the waters, and Chriſt tolde Peter what death he ſhoulde die, and waſhed Peters feete firſt, and woulde haue his reſurrection declared firſt to Peter,</hi> and ſuch like other ſingularities. But it is moſt ridiculous to conclude that <hi>Peter</hi> was made monarke of the church, becauſe either Chriſt reuealed to him the hidden myſteries of the faith, or praide for him, or changed his name, or paide tribute for him, or made him walke on the ſea, or foretolde his death, or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his féete or did any ſuch like matter. For if euerie of theſe actions ſhoulde bring with it a monarchie, there woulde bée more monarkes, then monarchies. Moreouer the Noddy doth affirme diuers things moſt falſely, and impudently, which hée ſhall neuer bee able to prooue. For what can bée more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, then to thinke, that none euer vnderſtoode the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Chriſtes incarnation, and the holy Trinitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Peter?</hi> Againe what was reuealed to <hi>Peter,</hi> that was not
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:177777:114"/> likewiſe reuealed to other apoſtles? Moreouer it is manifeſt, that Chriſt<note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.</note> praied as well for the reſt of the apoſtles, as for <hi>Peter,</hi> and changed both <hi>Matthew</hi> the apoſtles name, and the names of the ſonnes of <hi>Zebedei,</hi> and tolde them, what death they ſhoulde die, as well as <hi>Peter.</hi> Finally it is moſt vntrue that Chriſt praied, that the gates of hell ſhoulde not preuaile againſt the popes ſeate, whom they take to bée <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, or that he paide tribute for <hi>Peter</hi> alone. Why then doth he auouch theſe matters ſo confidently, and leaueth them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proofes ſo nakedly?</p>
                     <p>To ſupply his former weake argument, he procéedeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and telleth vs, <hi>That Peter firſt called a councell, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Matthias to be choſen in the place of Iudas, and firſt after the comming of the holy ghoſt publiſhed the goſpell.</hi> He tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs alſo, <hi>That Peter wrought the firſt miracle, and as high iudge condemned Ananias and Sapphira to death, and that he firſt ſaw by a viſion, that the gentiles were to be admitted to Chriſtianity.</hi> Likewiſe, <hi>That he paſſed through all, and that Paul went vp to Ierruſalem to ſee Peter,</hi> and finally, <hi>That Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Chriſtes ſpeciall order left Antioche and went to Rome.</hi> But if theſe be the grounds of <hi>Peters</hi> monarchie, and of the Romiſh faith, it muſt néedes fall out, that the faith of papiſts is built not onely vpon ſand, but vpon méere coniectures and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſo weake, that they cannot bring forth any ſtrong conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For what is more vaine and ridiculous, then to conclude that <hi>Peter</hi> was chiefe and vniuerſall monarke of the church, becauſe he wrought the firſt miracle, and was viſited of <hi>Paul,</hi> and went to Antioche? Beſides, it ſtandeth on falſe poſitions. Firſt it is no where written, <hi>That Peter called the firſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</hi> Nay it is apparent, that returning from the mount of oliues, they all came together of their owne accord, without commaundement from <hi>Peter.</hi> Secondly <hi>Matthias</hi> was not choſen by the apoſtles, but by God himſelfe. Thirdly <hi>Peter</hi> wrought not the firſt miracle. For what greater miracle, then that the apoſtles ſpoke with tongues, which they had not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: which was common to them all? Fourthly he condemned not <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> as high iudge, no nor by way of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dciall procéeding, but rather by miracle wrought their death. Fiftly it is moſt abſurd to thinke, that the other apoſtles did not vnderſtand, that the gentiles were to be called to the faith,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:177777:114"/> when ſending them into the world our ſauiour bad them, <hi>Go teach all nations.</hi> Laſtly it is no where to be ſhewed, that Chriſt gaue any ſpeciall commaundement, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould remooue his ſeat from Antioche to Rome. If this hoddy Noddy thinke otherwiſe, let him if he canne, bring foorth his proofes, and ſhew where this commaundement is to be ſéene. And if he meane to prooue <hi>Peter</hi> to haue béene conſtituted head mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the church by theſe grounds, he may do well to frame his arguments, and to prooue his poſitions ſoundly. If not, then we do him to vnderſtand, that all that monarchie, which the papiſts ſo much ſtande vpon, is built vpon fancies, and dreames, and méere foolerie without firme foundation.</p>
                     <p>To ſtrengthen his weake building, hée doth in the ende take vpon him a great matter. For he<note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>P.</hi> 100.</note> vaunteth, <hi>That hee will ſhew foorth a plaine commiſſion for the monarchicall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of Peter, giuen him by Chriſt, in two places recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, beſide others not recorded. The firſt</hi> ſaith hée, <hi>is in theſe words Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>Thou art Peter or a Rocke. The ſecond in theſe Iohn</hi> 21. <hi>Feede my lambes, feede my ſheepe.</hi> In the wordes written by <hi>Matthew,</hi> he telleth vs, <hi>That the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie of the church is promiſed to Peter, as the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues do ſhew, and the conſent of ancient fathers both Greeke and Latine doth expound.</hi> In the latter hée ſaith, <hi>Peter was made paſtor generall of all Chriſtes flocke, as both the words themſelues do import, and all antiquitie with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hath euer taken the ſenſe to be.</hi> And this is the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, theſe are the recordes, theſe the proofes, which he vanteth of. But if hée acquit not himſelfe the better, he will be taken and conuicted for a forger of falſe patents and commiſſions, for a falſifier of recordes, and for a corrupter of fathers, and a vaine pretender of antiquitie. And all that read his vaine writings with iudgement, will condemne him woorthie, if not to haue his eares clipped, becauſe our procéeding is not before the tribunall of iudges, yet to haue his coxcombe pared for crowing, and crying ſo loude, and ſo proudly vpon ſo little cauſe. For firſt the wordes of Chriſt are not, <hi>Thou art Peter, or a Rocke?</hi> As hée forgeth changing a proper name into a noune appellatiue; but ſimply <hi>Thou art Peter.</hi> Secondly he confeſſeth himſelfe, that Chriſt in the firſt place giueth nothing, but onely promiſeth. Now it is no warrant
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:177777:115"/> for any to alledge a promiſe of a commiſſion, vnleſſe he canne prooue an act paſſed, or elſe exhibite the commiſſion it ſelfe. Thirdly nothing is here promiſed to <hi>Peter,</hi> but the keyes of the church. But thoſe keyes are common not onely to the apoſtles, but alſo to all true paſtors, and ſucceſſors of the apoſtles, and therefore cannot ſignifie any ſole, monarchicall, or ſupreme gouernement of the whole church. Fourthly ſuppoſe that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> were in this place promiſed to be made the rocke and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the church, which as the fathers expound it, was onely in reſpect of his confeſſion, or of Chriſt the rocke which he confeſſed; yet that is no priuiledge, nor matter properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Peter,</hi> but a common graunt made to all the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who in reſpect of their doctrine, and after a ſort, may be termed the<note n="a" place="margin">Epheſ. <hi>2.</hi> &amp; Apoc. <hi>21.</hi>
                        </note> foundation of the church. Fiftly it cannot be ſhewed, that any gréeke, or latin fathers do ſo expound the wordes <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. as if Chriſt meant to giue to <hi>Peter</hi> the ſole monarchicall gouernement of the church. Let them ſpeake in their owne wordes, and he ſhall perceiue it to be, as I ſay. Nay it appeareth by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe, that no ſuch matter canne be prooued by the fathers. Sixtly Chriſt ſaying to <hi>Peter, feed my ſheepe,</hi> and redoubling his charge thrée times, gaue him not any new authority, but rather ſtirred him vp to the execution of his office, and ſought to draw from him a thrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fould confeſſion, to anſwere his former thréefould deniall. And ſo ſaith <hi>Nazianzen in Orat. in ſanct epiph. lumina,</hi> and <hi>Cyrill</hi> vpon <hi>Iohn, Lib.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 44. and <hi>Auguſtin. tract.</hi> 123. <hi>in Ioan. &amp; de vtilit. poenit. c.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; ſerm.</hi> 149. <hi>de tempore.</hi> Seuenthly the charge of féeding was as well committed to all the apoſtles <hi>Matth</hi> 28. as to <hi>Peter. Iohn</hi> 21. Laſtly not one of the fathers doth by theſe wordes prooue, that <hi>Peter</hi> was ordeined the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall, and ſole ſupreme gouernour of the church. Saint<note n="b" place="margin">In c. vlt. Luc.</note> 
                        <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Peter was preferred before all the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> but he ſpeaketh not of his office or function, but of loue &amp; affection. For ſpeaking of all the apoſtles, he ſaith,<note n="c" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                        <hi>Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter praedicandi his per totum orbem mandat officium.</hi> Saint<note n="d" place="margin">In c. Ioan. vlt.</note> 
                        <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith onely, <hi>That Chriſt committed his ſheepe to be fedde of Peter.</hi> But ſo hée did alſo commit them to be fedde of the reſt of the apoſtles, when he gaue them authoritie to teach all nations.<note n="e" place="margin">In c. <hi>21.</hi> Ioan.</note> 
                        <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt committed to Peter the care of his brethren:</hi> but we may not imagine,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:177777:115"/> that other apoſtles were careleſſe, or had no care committed to them; neither may we imagine, that all are ſupreme and ſole gouernors, that haue care committed to them. <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> doth<note n="a" place="margin">In Anchirat.</note> teſtifie, <hi>That Chriſt committed his ſheepefold to Peter.</hi> So do the holy ſcriptures teſtifie, that the apoſtles had all commiſſion to féede Chriſtes ſhéepe, and to gouerne his folde.

For he is not the Rocke, of which Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, he hath not the keies of heauen deliuered vnto him, hée féedeth not Chriſtes ſhéepe, nor liueth in poore eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, nor ſuffereth perſecution, as did the holie apoſtle ſaint <hi>Peter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſaith the woordy Warder our aduerſarie, <hi>All the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian worlde hath made euer this moſt certaine and infallible deduction; that Chriſt gaue not Saint Peter theſe eminent prerogatiues for himſelfe alone, but for his poſteritie and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors alſo, that ſhould enſue him in his ſeat to the worlds end.</hi> As if whatſoeuer Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had, muſt neceſſarily deſcend to his counterfect ſucceſſors the popes of Rome. Beſide that, the vanitie of this bragge of all the chriſtian worlde, and of the infallibilitie of this collection may appéere in diuers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. Firſt it is cléere, that diuers of <hi>Peters</hi> prerogatiues were perſonall, as to haue his name changed, to bée called <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> to worke miracles, to ſpeake with toongs, to confeſſe Chriſt thrée times, and ſuch other like. And therefore ſtrange it is, that this ignorant fellow durſt either talke of all the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian worlde, wherein he is but a ſtranger, or woulde ſay, that all the chriſtian world beléeued theſe prerogatiues of <hi>Peter</hi> to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:177777:116"/> belong to the popes of Rome. Secondly it can neuer be proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that <hi>Peter</hi> had, or that the worlde beléeued, that hée had power to depoſe kings, to tranſlate kingdomes, to diſpence with othes, to grant pardons, to releaſe out of purgatorie, to heare appeales out of all the worlde, and ſuch like points of the popes power. Thirdly, admit <hi>Peter</hi> had apoſtolicall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ouer the whole worlde, yet neither was that proper to <hi>Peter,</hi> nor did any ſounde doctor of the church, or true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian imagine, that whatſoeuer belonged to <hi>Peter,</hi> deſcended to the pope of Rome. Fourthly the aduerſaries themſelues cannot prooue this ſucceſſion by any ſuch infallible and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine deduction, as is pretended. Wherefore vnleſſe this Nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can ſhew, firſt that the pope hath ſuccéeded <hi>Peter</hi> in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall charge of apoſtolicall gouernment, and teaching throughout the worlde; and ſecondly, that the pope is a true biſhop, paſtor, and ſucceſſor of <hi>Peter:</hi> and thirdly, that neither the biſhops of Antioch, nor Caeſarea, nor Ioppe, nor Lydda where <hi>Peter</hi> taught, nor any, ſaue the biſhops of Rome, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded in <hi>Peters</hi> ſeate: and fourthly that the popes authoritie in giuing lawes, in cenſures, exactions, diſpenſations, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was generally allowed and neuer contradicted: and finally that he ſtill holdeth the apoſtolike doctrine and faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, and admitteth no hereſies, nor falſe opinions in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: vnleſſe I ſay he prooue all this, he is at the end of his rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning for the popes authoritie, and ſheweth himſelfe to bée but a vaine babler, and a fooliſh challenger, that euen in the midſt of danger conueieth himſelfe out of the <hi>ſteccato.</hi> And I do much woonder, that all true Chriſtians do not ſuſpect this manner of procéeding, and deteſt the pride and vanitie of this diſcourſer, that leaueth his miſerable diſciples more perplexed, then before. For he teacheth, that vpon paine of damnation they muſt ſubiect themſelues to the popes authoritie, and yet when it commeth to the iumpe, he is neither able to iuſtifie the popes authoritie in making and diſſoluing lawes, nor in ordering biſhops throughout the worlde, nor in iudging of controuerſies, nor authorizing the ſcriptures, nor in diſpenſing in caſes reſerued, nor in depoſing princes, nor in raiſing warres, and handling both the ſwords, and ſuch like matters. Nay he is not able to prooue, that he is <hi>Peters</hi> true ſucceſſour, or a lawfull biſhop. He teacheth ſubiects to rebell, and ſetteth
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:177777:116"/> princes to murder Chriſtians, and blinde papiſts blindely obey; and yet no warrant can the popes proctor bring, to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the popes ſtrange deſſeines, and dooings.</p>
                     <p>Onely he endeuoureth in the laſt end of his pleading for the pope, to ſhew <hi>That this land ought eſpecially to reſpect the ſea of Rome for beeing twiſe conuerted from paganiſme to Chriſtian religion: and that firſt by Eleutherius; then by Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory the firſt, which were both biſhops of Rome.</hi> And here he triumpeth, and thinking that he hath ſatiſfied his reader with an exquiſite and delicate diſh at the ending of his papall ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet; he taketh away the table, and biddeth all his gueſts <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> and <hi>à dieu.</hi> But if his readers be not more wary, while they thinke to be fed with holeſome meat, they are like to be gulled which googeons. This gull certes in this his cataſtrophe ſéemeth to haue no other purpoſe. For firſt it is a méere fable to ſay, that this land was conuerted from paganiſme either by the one, or by the other of theſe two. For Chriſtianity was in England long before <hi>Eleutherius</hi> time, and ſtories ſay, he did onely, and that by his deputies, chriſten king <hi>Lucius.</hi> And when <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the monke came to the Saxons, the Britons long before that were Chriſtians. Secondly neither did <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius,</hi> nor <hi>Gregory</hi> preach the faith here, nor giue much aide to the conuerſion of the people of this land. Onely <hi>Eleutherius</hi> ſent <hi>Eluanus</hi> and <hi>Meduinus</hi> two Britons otherwiſe called <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> to king Lucius, and <hi>Gregory</hi> ſent <hi>Auſtin</hi> the monke hither. But the Saxons were conuerted by certaine Britons and French, that could ſpeake the Saxon language, and not by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that could do nothing, but hould y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe like a croſier-clerke, whiles others preached. Thirdly albeit this land had béene conuerted by <hi>Eleutherius</hi> and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> yet this is but a perſonall fauour, rather making vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to thoſe two, then to thoſe, that ſuccéeded them. To prooue that we owe any obedience to the ſea of Rome for that cauſe, this argument is all too weake. For the church of Rome was firſt conuerted by thoſe that came from Ieruſalem: yet doth not Rome yéelde any obedience to the biſhops of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. Nay they haue forgotten Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> whome we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, preached at Rome, and do all depend of <hi>Peter.</hi> Likewiſe the Phryſons and Germanes were conuerted by Saxons out of England; yet do they not ſubiect themſelues to the church of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:177777:117"/> England. Fourthly the late popes of Rome haue béene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beholding to the kings and people of this country. One king gaue the tribute of peter pence: others gaue them great priuiledges and authority; by which meanes they drew out infinite treaſure out of England. <hi>Bonner</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">In praefat. in lib. de ver. obed.</note> ſaith, that the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the pope out of England were equall to the kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenues. In requitall whereof the popes haue<note n="b" place="margin">Matth. Paris.</note> ſent to our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces either glaſſes, or feathers, or rotten bones, or paper &amp; lead, and ſuch like toies. <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth gaue to our princes a title to Ireland, which he had no power to giue. <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth to king <hi>Henry</hi> the thirdes ſonne gaue a bare title to the kingdome of Naples, which coſt infinite treaſure, &amp; in the end prooued a méere mockerie. Other popes haue ſhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alwaies oppoſite to the Engliſh nation, &amp; to the kings of this realme. No ſooner had the pope intelligence, that <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> of Normandie was purpoſed to come with a puiſſant ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to conquer this lande (which coulde not be done without great waſte, wracke and ſlaughter) but hée<note n="c" place="margin">Matth.

So much did it pleaſe him, to heare of an inuaſion of our countrey, and ſo holy a thing did warre and waſte of this kingdome ſéeme vnto him. Another pope did vpholde <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> and his rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious conſorts againſt king <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, fauored his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enimies, and in the end forced him to a moſt ſhamefull penance.<note n="d" place="margin">Matth. Paris in Ioanne.</note> 
                        <hi>Innocent</hi> the thirde thundred out his excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations againſt king <hi>Iohn,</hi> and ſtirred vp forreine enimies againſt him. Neither did he euer ceaſe to purſue him, vntill ſuch time as he had made both the king himſelfe, and as much as in him lay, all his people tributarie to forreiners. At which when the Nobilitie and people of England repined, the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pope in great choler<note n="e" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> ſent out his interdictions, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications and curſes againſt them, and neuer ceaſed to purſue them, as long as he had meanes to hurt them. In the warres, which the kings of England made in France, for the obteining of their right in that kingdome, the popes croſſed them by all meanes poſſible, and declared themſelues vtter enimies to our nation, being glad of any calamitie that hapned to vs, and ſorrowfull for our good ſucceſſe. But neuer did anie declare more malice againſt any of our kinges, then <hi>Paule</hi> the third againſt king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight the Quéenes moſt noble

                        </note> bull, which he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed againſt him. For therein hée doth not onely curſe the king, and ſtirreth vp both his ſubiects, and forreine enimies againſt him; but alſo curſeth and banneth all his friends, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, and partakers. Their goods hée giueth away for a ſpoile; their perſons hée will haue ſolde for ſlaues; and the waſte of the whole lande hée woulde haue remaine, as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of his holineſſes great diſpleaſure. Neither did it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him to proſecute the liuing onely, vnleſſe the dead alſo were throwne out into the fieldes, as vnwoorthy of chriſtian buriall. Such is the charitie of his holineſſe towards chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and his louing affection toward the Engliſh nation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>Paule</hi> the thirdes fact ſingular. For in our times <hi>Pius quintus,</hi> and <hi>Sixtus quintus</hi> haue publiſhed no leſſe odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſcandalous excommunications againſt her moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Maieſtie, moſt bitterly curſing her, and all her louing ſubiects, then their predeceſſor did againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the eight and his people.</p>
                     <p>Further they haue not onely gone about to trouble this ſtate by rebellions, but alſo to ſubuert it by forreine<note n="b" place="margin">The plots were taken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Criton a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, Throg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton and others.</note> inuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Haue wee not then great cauſe to honor and loue the popes holineſſe, that hath ſhewed himſelfe ſo friendly to our princes, and nation? Wée may do well alſo to entertaine ſuch prieſtes and friers, as come from him, ſéeing they wiſh vs no more harme, then the deſtruction of the prince, the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of religion and the ſtate, &amp; the ſlaughter of our people. Neither haue they any thing in their vowes, but that all our throtes were cut by the Spaniard. Nay when neither by open hoſtilitie, nor ſecret treaſons and practiſe they could preuaile againſt vs, they haue encouraged certaine railing and ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous companions by infamous libels to defame her Maieſtie, to raile on her chéefe Counſellors, and to diſhonor all our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thoſe eſpecially that haue ſhewed themſelues moſt forward in dooing God and their countrey ſeruice. This pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting companion ſheweth himſelfe verie ſpitefull, albeit hée woulde diſſemble it. <hi>Sanders, Riſhton, Allen, Ribadineira</hi> and others haue publiſhed cart-lodes of ſlanders and lies againſt the Prince, the Nobilitie, and diuers other honeſt men.</p>
                     <p>Finally beſide theſe wrongs and diſgraces, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:177777:118"/> matters temporall, the popes of Rome haue gone about to wrong vs in matters ſpirituall, which concerne the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſoules. For they haue not onely ſought to depriue vs of the worde of God in our mothers language, of true faith and doctrine, of the ſincere adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and of a true miniſterie according to Chriſt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: but alſo in lieu thereof to eſtabliſh the idolatrous worſhip to ſtocke and ſtones, of angels, of ſaints departed; and to bring into the church the abomination of the maſſe, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with manifold ſuperſtitions, impieties and hereſies. And for this cauſe they haue ſecretly ſent into this lande diuers<note n="a" place="margin">It is thought, that aboue <hi>400.</hi> of them, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed in diuers corners in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> troopes of maſſing prieſtes and friers all marked with anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtes brand, to ſeduce ſimple people, and to draw them to ſuperſtition, idolatrie, and hereſie. Wherefore let all true chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and true harted Engliſhmen open their eies and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, that they be not oppreſſed both with ſpirituall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall bondage and ſlauerie. This is it which the popes of Rome entend, and haue by ſo many practiſes laboured: this is alſo the drift of this glauering paraſites diſcourſe.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Oth I am and very vnwilling, where the different betwixt vs and the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard hath béene ſo long in deciding by blowes, to begin any long contention about words &amp; termes. It is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſaying, words are light as winde, and men of action, in wordes commonly vſe leaſt oſtentation. Beſide that, I
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:177777:118"/> holde it no good courſe to ſet out inuectiues againſt princes, and eſpecially ſuch, as are now departed this life, and haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued their guerdon, whether they haue done good or euill. The popes and their paraſites take to themſelues libertie in infinite ſlanderous pamphlets to diſgrace all men oppoſite to their faction, neither ſparing prince nor priuate perſon, liuing nor dead: but all honeſt men deteſt this frierlike faſhion. I thinke it alſo a vaine thing, to recount matters formerly paſt, that concerne vs little or nothing.</p>
                     <p>But yet ſeeing this pratling and buſie felow our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie will néedes haue the Spanyards and their late king the ſubiect of this encounter, and like a fugitiue traytor ſticketh not to aduance them aboue his owne nation, and to pleade their cauſe againſt his owne prince and country; I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thus farre to reaſon of them, as that men may learne how farre to truſt them, and vnderſtand, that we haue no reaſon either to feare their force, or to yéelde them any ſuperiority, or to thinke better of the Spanyard, then of our owne nation. Laſtly leaſt any might ſuppoſe our aduerſary to haue ſpoken wiſely and learnedly, I will briefely runne ouer his diſcourſe, and note the leudneſſe, and vnſufficiency of his pleading. His vnnaturall and vnkind dealing againſt his prince and nation, before which he taketh on him to preferre the Spaniard, I néede not to note, for it is too too apparent, and ſufficientlie knowne to any, that will take paines to read ouer his idle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                     <p>The time hath béene, when the Engliſh and Spaniardes did well agrée, as appeared not onely by mutuall trade and conuerſation of both nations one with another, but alſo by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers publike contractes and leagues made betwixt them. Sometime the kinges of England matched with the houſe of Spaine, and ſometime the Spaniſh kings haue had their wiues out of England; and both of them eſtéemed much of the amity eache of other: albeit the Spaniard hath béene more happy to receiue more profit of this coniunction with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, then our nation by our matches and linking with the houſe of Spaine. For by the aide of our archery the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes diuers times haue obteined victory againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mores: and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> king of Caſtile béeing expulſed by his ſubiects; by the blacke prince, and the Engliſh forces was reſtored to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:177777:119"/> his kingdome. Neither could <hi>Ferdinand</hi> king of Spaine ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily haue poſſeſſed the kingdome of Nauarre, had not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Engliſh ſent for his aide by king <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeuenth diſtracted the French ſo, that they could not come in time to ſuccor their friends diſtreſſed. Contrarywiſe king <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt matching with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe of Caſtile receiued ſmal aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as is declared in the chronicle of<note n="a" place="margin">In Henric. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Matthew</hi> of Paris: and king <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeuenth matching with <hi>Catherine</hi> of Spaine, preſently loſt his ſonne and heire. The ſame woman alſo béeing maried afterward to king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, was like to haue cauſed great trouble both to the king, and this realme, vpon the diſſolution of that vnlawfull contract; if the kings vigilancie and magnanimitie had not ſurmounted the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Great friendſhip likewiſe hath béene betwéene our kings, and the dukes of Burgundy, of whome the late kings of Spaine are lineally deſcended: betwixt the Engliſh nation, &amp; the people of the low countries depending on the houſe of Burgundie. The nations by mutuall trade reaped great profit each of other. The princes by the aide and countenance each of other were much ſtrengthened againſt their common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. <hi>Charles</hi> the fift in his time much eſtéemed for his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, did make ſo great accompt of our nation, that he choſe <hi>Mary</hi> Quéene of England, as a fit match for his ſonne <hi>Philip,</hi> to whome he left all his dominions; and dying, gaue his ſonne this ſpeciall charge, that he ſhould neuer breake with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, nor looſe the fauour of our nation. He did wiſely conſider our ſtrength by ſea, and what aide we were able to afford him béeing friend; and what hurt we might do vnto him, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned our forces with his enimies.</p>
                     <p>Much it were to be wiſhed, that the frendſhip of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard had béene as profitable to the Engliſh nation, as the friendſhip of the Engliſh was to the Spanyard. But then we ſhould not haue loſt Guines and Caleis by this coniunction, nor béene ſpoiled of the remainder of the ancient conqueſt of our anceſtors in France by his meanes; neither then ſhould the Engliſh for his pleaſure haue béene intricated with the warres with France. Howſoeuer the ſame ought to haue béene profitable vnto vs; yet for our goodwill a man would neuer haue thought, that we ſhould haue reaped diſpleaſure
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:177777:119"/> and wrong.</p>
                     <p>Yet we ſée, what is come to paſſe. This league of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is broken, and all ancient good offices doone by our nation to the Spaniard quite forgotten. King <hi>Philip</hi> when her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie came firſt to the crowne, forgot not onely the bond of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance with her ſiſter, but alſo his fathers charge. In the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of peace betwéene France and Spaine, he<note n="a" place="margin">Guicciardin de paeſi baſſi.</note> forſooke his ſiſter and left her to ſhift for her ſelfe; and that alſo in a war, which himſelfe had begun.

                     <p>When ſecret practiſes of rebelles preuailed not, the king prouided a nauy which his flatterers called inuincible, and a great force and army of land ſouldiors, determining with fire

But whatſoeuer the ſuccſſe was, it appeareth, that this was no brotherly part, thus to inuade her Maieſty; nor any point of a catholicke and Chriſtian king, to oppugne peacible Chriſtians for the profeſſion of true catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke religion.</p>
                     <p>Nay albeit this great loſſe and ſhame, might haue forced him to acknowledge Gods iuſtice and powerfull working againſt him, and cauſed him to ſurceaſe his cruell perſecution againſt Chriſtians; yet did the ſame worke nothing in his hard hart; nor coulde hée be induced to giue ouer his former deſſeignements ſo long as breath laſted. <hi>anno</hi> 1594. being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie weake, and for ſome daies ſpéechleſſe, the<note n="a" place="margin">This was written out of Spaine.</note> firſt wordes which he vttered after he came to himſelfe were theſe, <hi>Is the adelantado gone for England?</hi> So much was his head trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about that voyage. His friends alſo report, that he ſhould ſay, that hée woulde ſell his ſiluer candleſtickes, and the reſt of the furniture of his chappell, before hée woulde giue ouer the warres againſt England. And I beléeue it to bée true, ſéeing notwithſtanding diuers repulſes and infinite loſſes <hi>anno</hi> 1588. 1594. 1595. and 1599. hée neuer gaue ouer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time, as hée gaue vp his ſpirite, and yéelded to nature.</p>
                     <p>The papiſtes do excéedingly commend his zeale in popiſh religion, or rather his great hatred againſt the profeſſors of true religion. So earneſt he was in this cauſe, that he ſpared not his owne onely déere ſonne, for that he was thought to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor that truth which we profeſſe. <hi>E coſa molto notabile,</hi> ſaith<note n="b" place="margin">In vita Pij <hi>5.</hi>

The duke of Alua before that was likewiſe deſirous, that his ſonne might paſſe with forces into England for the aide of the northren rebells. And that of long time hath béene a common argument for prieſts and friers to handle in their ſermons. They haue alſo<note n="d" place="margin">Theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons were found vpon diuers Spaniards ann. <hi>1588.</hi>
                        </note> preached indulgences and remiſſion of ſinnes, and offred the ſame to all, that would fight againſt vs, accompting it percaſe meritorious to kill any of our nation. If their iourney 1588. had ſuccéeded, either they had killed our people, or made ſlaues of them to worke in their Indian mines, or to rowe in their gallies, or elſe to do other baſe and ſeruile worke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our goods they had already ſwallowed in their hope, and meant to haue deuided the land amongſt them, and to haue raigned here like great conquerors. And albeit at that time they had no good ſucceſſe, yet haue they not giuen ouer their hope, nor ceaſed to take all opportunities to worke vs either diſhonor, or
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:177777:121"/> domage.</p>
                     <p>I omit to ſpeak of the wrongs they haue done to particulers, albeit many &amp; gréeuous; for that our diſpute is about the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Spaniardes to our whole nation. And yet many particular wrongs, and actes of iniuſtice &amp; crueltie doe argue a great hatred to the Engliſh in generall. But to forbeare to ſpeake of particular actions, and of generall attempts former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſed, it appéereth they meane not thus to giue vs ouer. For out of Spaine there come prieſtes and others daily to practiſe treaſon againſt her Maieſtie and the ſtate. It is not long, ſince <hi>Squire</hi> was executed for a moſt horrible treaſon plotted in Seuile. Neither can the ſhameleſſe &amp; impudent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials and cauils of Ieſuites and prieſts which they make at the proceſſe againſt him, either make that vndoone which is done, or qualifie ſo foule a fact. Nay admit the poore fellow ſhoulde erre in ſome circumſtance, yet no reaſon can be allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged why hée ſhoulde accuſe and charge himſelfe in a matter that concerned his life, wrongfully. And to the entent there may bée a ſucceſſion of traytors and conſpirators which may make the way more readie for their intended inuaſions and conqueſtes; at common coſtes they maintaine two Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Engliſh fugitiues and traytors. I know they pretend planting of popiſh religion: but if that were their onelie marke they aime at, why doth<note n="a" place="margin">Testified againſt him by priests in their memorials.</note> 
                        <hi>Parſons</hi> cauſe euerie one of them that come for England to take an oath, that they ſhall to their vttermoſt power prefer the Infantaes of Spaines ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the crowne of England? Is this no point of treaſon? And doth not this flowe from ſome purpoſe of the Spaniard againſt our countrey and nation?</p>
                     <p>To make our nation hatefull, <hi>Ribadineira</hi> a certaine ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldly frier hath publiſhed a moſt odious diſcourſe of ſchiſme in Spaniſh, wherein hée omitteth nothing that may procure vs diſhonor or hinderance.</p>
                     <p>And yet theſe are the men, whom our aduerſarie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth and defendeth, and vnto whom Cardinall <hi>Allen, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Parſons,</hi> and other Ieſuites and prieſts, that lurke among vs, haue vowed their ſeruice.</p>
                     <p>Great reaſon therefore hath our nation, where ſo violent enimies ſéeke to hurt vs, and ſo malicious traytors endeuour to enſnare vs, to watch and looke about. Our aduerſary crieth
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:177777:121"/> peace, peace, but war is in his hart. hée may tell vs as long as hée liſteth, that the Spaniards are our good friends, and meane vs no hurt at all. But if wée liſt to arme our ſelues, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent their malice; wée may aſſure our ſelues, if God be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that they neither dare fight with vs, nor can bée able to hurt vs. Theſe double toonged traytors pretend good dealing, and vſe many kinde wordes, as if they loued their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. but who can truſt them, that are ſo néere linked by oath, friendſhip, and opinion to publike enimies? Finally now the Spaniardes and other publike enimies ſéeme to haue laide aſide their armes: but yet it is not ſafe to truſt them. After great calmes oft-times ariſe great ſtormes. We muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that king <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond was alwaies ready to execute the popes command, and was ſtill ſet on by the Ieſuites,<note place="margin">Acosta in his booke of the new world calleth it, Praeclarum Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in expug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandis &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellandis fidei (Romanae) ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtibus. in praefa. ad Philip.</note> and commended for his zeale in oppugning the enimies of the Romiſh faith. The whole Spaniſh nation is alſo much deuoted to popiſh religion, and very ready to execute the popes commandements.</p>
                     <p>Wée muſt alſo conſider that it is no argument of a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to peace, that ſuch great forces of men are continually le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied throughout moſt of the parts of Spaine and Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall; and that ſuch numbers of ſhips of warre are either made of late, or in making, as wée haue not heard of manie yéeres before; and that ſuch care is had of prouiſions of corne, wine, munitions, and other things neceſſary for the wars, as is not vſual. I confeſſe, that by reaſon of the kings large domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and great occaſions and affaires, theſe prouiſions are neceſſarie: yet vnleſſe hée had ſome extraordinarie purpoſe, neither woulde his prouiſions be ſo great, nor ſhould his men march toward Liſbone and Coronna, nor his Magazins bée dreſſed in thoſe parts, that looke hitherward.</p>
                     <p>Further it woulde not be forgotten, how much it gréeueth the Spaniſh nation, that they haue béene diſturbed by vs in their trade to the Indies, and purſued by our ſhippes euen to their owne doores. The enterpriſes alſo of Portugall and Caliz are no ſmall corroſiue to their hautie harts. And no doubt they ſée, how that to ſecure their Indies, and their owne countries both of Spaine, and Flaunders, and the partes adioining, they haue no meanes, but by making warres vpon vs.</p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:177777:122"/>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe the Spaniards ſhoulde neither reſpect their profite, honor, nor ſafetie, or that they woulde by concluſions of peace prouide for themſelues, and their owne indemnitie: yet what aſſurance can wée haue, either that any peace will bée concluded, or that it will certainly bée performed, when the Spaniards<note n="a" place="margin">Pope Pius <hi>5.</hi> and Sixtus <hi>5.</hi> excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions take hold of them, if they ſhould.</note> dare not once treate of peace with vs, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by the pope, without expreſſe licence; nor may performe their grants further, then ſhall pleaſe the<note n="b" place="margin">The canoniſts giue him power to diſpence with oathes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue contracts, and he chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere by Paulus <hi>3.</hi> his bull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst k.

Or will he reuoke ſo many ſentences of excommunication and decretals, as haue béene made againſt her Maieſty and her ſubiects, that we may now enioy a firme peace? When was euer any ſuch thing done? Nay the popes authoritie ſtanding in many places, how can any ſuch matter bée done? If then the pope cauſe his Iubiley and indulgences to bée preached and publiſhed in Spaine againſt vs; and if hée offer full remiſſion of ſinnes to all, that will take armes, or ſend foorth ſoldiers againſt Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, do wée not thinke, that there will bée a great ſtirre in Spaine? Do wée not know how much the Spaniardes are addicted to theſe opinions, and how they beleeue that the pope hath Saint <hi>Peters</hi> keies and power either to ſend men to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or to hell? Great reaſon therefore had our good knight, hearing of great preparations made in Spaine, and combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of<note n="c" place="margin">There are troupes of them ſent ouer into England daily.</note> popiſh prieſtes diſperſed euery where in England, and conſidering the ſtate of both nations, to giue the alarme to his countreymen, and to exhort them to prepare themſelues to reſiſt ſo great and violent an enimie, as ment the vtter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of the ſtate, and the deſtruction of our moſt déere coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Neither had our aduerſarie any reaſon to take this in dudgeon, or to miſlike their forwardneſſe that armed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vpon their princes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, &amp; reſolued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to fight for their prince, their countrey, their religion, their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, their lawes, their wife, their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their friends, their goods, and whatſoeuer they now enioie by this gouernment; but that hée declareth himſelfe a traytor to his prince and countrey, and an vtter enimie to true religion, and that hée hath renounced all affection toward his nation, to ioine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to Spaniardes, Italians, Mores and barbarous people culled out of diuers countries, and thought fit to be emploied
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:177777:122"/> in this ſeruice againſt vs. Neither woulde hée haue declared ſo much to the worlde, had hée not well anſwered his name, and ſhewed himſelfe a Noddy, not knowing how euill it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéemeth him that ioineth with publike enimies, to pretende loue and friendſhip to his owne nation. And therefore, albeit peace bée a gladſome matter, and much to bée deſired; yet wee haue no reaſon either to harken to this trecherous friers tale, or ouer farre to truſt to parlies or offers of peace made by the Spaniardes. Oftentimes ſwordes may bée couered vnder branches of laurell. But this our ſuperiors will looke vnto, whom it ſpecially concerneth; vnto whoſe care I report me. This is ſufficient to ſhew, how little wée are to truſt the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, whom our aduerſarie ſo much aduanceth.</p>
                     <p>Now it followeth, that I ſhew briefly, that we haue leſſe cauſe to feare him, then to truſt him: which may euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péere by theſe particulars. Firſt our ſoldiers giue no place to the Spaniards, if they may méete them vpon equal termes: as experience &amp; triall in diuers encounters doth plainly declare. It is not long ſince our troops encountring them hand to hand betwixt Oſtend and Newport gaue them a greater foile, then they haue receiued within our memorie. The effects do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew it, ſéeing they haue béene quiet euer ſince. Our mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are without compariſon better men at the ſea, then theirs, and more able and ſkilfull in managing of their ſhips, and better do they vnderſtand the nature of theſe ſeas, and the ſituation of Ilandes, portes and harbors in theſe partes, then the Spaniards.</p>
                     <p>Our ſhips are better of ſaile, and better accommodated for ſhot and great ordonance, then thoſe of the Spaniards. And being aſſiſted with the fléete of our aſſociates of the Low countries, farre ſuperior to any fléete in the world.</p>
                     <p>If the Spaniards come into theſe ſeas, we haue both the ſeas, the harbors and portes fauorable, and may haue preſent ſupply of any thing wée want; which they being farre from home, cannot looke nor hope for.</p>
                     <p>If the Spaniard come into theſe ſeas, hée cannot long continue héere without encounter, nor depart at pleaſure, the windes being commonly ſoutherly and weſterly. But if our fléete ſhould go into the Indies with any ſtrength, they might either take any Iland or porte, or ſaile along the coaſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:177777:123"/> with more commoditie.</p>
                     <p>They can winne little by vs, but blowes, for that our ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are not great, nor eaſie to bée come by. But if in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies or in Spaine we ouercome them, our ſpoile cannot chooſe but be great, their trade being for golde, and ſiluer, and things of great value.</p>
                     <p>If any ſuppoſe the Spaniard to be inuincible, conſidering our want, and his abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of treaſure; he muſt thinke firſt, that as his reuenues are great, ſo his imployments are many; and that he wanteth oftentimes mony to pay his ſouldiors, and ſet his ſhips to ſea. Nay he wanteth mony to pay his debts, and defray neceſſary charges: inſomuch as king <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtreined to play<note n="a" place="margin">Anno Dom. <hi>1575.</hi> &amp; <hi>1597.</hi> as appee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations.</note> bankeroupt twiſe or thriſe in his time; and his ſouldiers for want of pay haue beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to rauage the country, and to mutine againſt their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders.</p>
                     <p>Secondly albeit we want the Indian mines; yet we want not meanes both to pay our ſouldiers and mariners; nor to furniſh them both by ſea and land; nor canne want ſufficient prouiſions of all ſorts, if we liſt to eſtabliſh a certaine courſe of procéeding for the continuance and maintenance of the warres.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly it is not mony that fighteth, nor hath principall vſe in warres, but men, iron, munition and neceſſary prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Neither do monyed men ſpoile the poore; but the poore ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſouldier, maketh a ſpoile of him, that is rich in mony. Laſtly as princes and ſtates, that haue great ſtore of treaſure haue meanes by their hired ſouldiers to make warres abrode, and hardly canne be ouercome that way; ſo are they weak, and vnable to reſiſte, if they be ſtrongly affronted and ſet vpon at home, where their treaſure lyeth, and their hired ſouldiers cannot be found. Which appeared by the example of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians; and may appeare by the Spanyardes, if wee pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>Now, our cauſe is farre more iuſt and honeſt, then the Spaniards.<note n="b" place="margin">In primis ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat, vt pacatè tantum &amp; ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiter viuat. Andreas Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopater p. <hi>14.</hi>

Her Maieſtie neuer wronged the Spaniard: nay ſhe hath not taken that, which lawes of warre, and all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did giue her. When the ſhippes, that carried mony to pay the ſouldiers in the low countries, that were prepared againſt her, and her country, were brought into her ports, and gaue her good meanes to helpe her ſelfe againſt her enimy; yet was ſhe content to reſtore the mony to the king. When the Ilandes of Azores were offered into her handes, yet did ſhe refuſe them. Nay ſhe would not accept of Antwerp and a great part of the low countries, that offered to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto her, béeing alwaies vnwilling to intricate herſelfe with vnneceſſary warres. Yet was ſhe aſſured, that this was moſt lawfull, and would be a certaine meanes, both to bring the Spaniard to any conditions, and to make the warres far from home, and vpon other mens charges. Nor in aſſiſting them of Holland and Zeland hath ſhe doone any thing, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had attempted all other meanes, and was forced to take this courſe by neceſſity for her owne ſafety. But the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards haue ſought matter of quarrell againſt her, and offered her and her people infinite wronges. Firſt king <hi>Philip</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing intricated our nation with the French about his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, loſt Caleis, and abandoned the Engliſh in his treatie of peace.

Anno 1588. he made open warres vpon vs, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſince hath ceaſed to moleſt vs. Nay when he could do her Maieſtie and her people no other harme, he hath ſuffered <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> booke of ſchiſme, and diuers other moſt rayling libells to be publiſhed by <hi>Ribadineira</hi> and others to the diſhonor of our nation, our princes, and gouernours.

Séeing then we haue ſuch meanes to make warres, and ſo iuſt a cauſe to vndertake them; why ſhould any eyther doubt, or feare to encounter
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:177777:124"/> the Spanyardes, eſpeciallie if they will néedes be quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?</p>
                     <p>But to ſurceaſe to diſcourſe of the valour of the Spaniard in the warres, and of his puiſſance, or rather weakeneſſe both by ſea and land; let vs a litle conſider him in his other parts and qualities, and ſée whether he deſerueth ſuch extrauagant commendations, as <hi>N. D</hi> doth heap vpon him, and what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he hath to aduance the Spanyard ſo highly, and to debaſe his owne nation. Our aduerſary<note n="a" place="margin">

For the religion of the Spaniard is not catholike, as we ſhall eaſily prooue, when we come to ſpeake of catholike religion. Nay few of that nation know any religion, but are ledde by the noſes by the pope and his prieſtes and friers, receiuing for truth whatſoeuer they teach, though neuer ſo falſe, &amp; not knowing the very grounds of Chriſtian faith, though neuer ſo true. Our aduerſary kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that the Spaniard is ſaide to account it but a <hi>Peccadillo</hi> or little fault, not to beléeue in Chriſt, and euery man may ſée, they haue no right faith, that receiue all the popes decretalles for true religion.</p>
                     <p>In the Indies their diſorders haue béene ſo great, that the barbarous people do beléeue rather any religion, then that of the Spanyard. <hi>Bartholomew à Caſas</hi> a fryer, and <hi>Hierome Benzo</hi> ſhew, that where in Hiſpaniola there were thrée milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of people at the firſt arriuall of the Spanyardes there, they ſhortly by their pious and vertuous gouernement, brought them to the number of 300.

But if hée were indéede deſirous to winne ſoules to Chriſt, and not gaine and glory to himſelfe; why doth hée not ſéeke to conuert the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Aſians, and Mores that are hard by him, and which through his ambitious quarrels about his ſuperioritie haue beene oppreſſed by the Turkes, and abandoned by the princes of the weſt empire? Doth it not appéere, that where Chriſtian princes rule with their ſword, hée entreth there into the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples cloſets with his counterfeit keies or rather picklockes; and that hée neither can do any thing in countries oppreſſed by infidels, nor is ſo willing to winne ſoules, as to eſtabliſh his authoritie, and to ſéeke gaine?</p>
                     <p>To returne to our purpoſe: In ſchoole diuinity diuers fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers I confeſſe ſéeme well ſtudied: neither are the Spaniardes ignorant of other humane artes and learning. Yet neither is the number of learned men great, nor their learning ſinguler. Their prieſts for the moſt part are ignorant both of tongues and of the grounds of religion. Their common people know almoſt nothing, and ſcarce canne ſay their <hi>Credo, pater noſter</hi> and <hi>aue maria.</hi> but admitte they canne ſay the wordes; yet are they ignorant of the ſence. Their morall vertues we will exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, when we come to ſpeake of particulars. It ſhould ſéeme they are not many, when their aduocate mentioneth none.</p>
                     <p>Finally it is but a ſimple praiſe to dwell in a rich and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile country. For ſo the Indians, and Cananites ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to be preferred before the Spaniardes. For no country is
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:177777:125"/> richer in gold, then the Indiaes. And in time paſt the land of Canaan flowed with milke and hony; and that is cléerely te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyfied of it in holy ſcripture.</p>
                     <p>But were it, that the Spaniardes deſerued commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their religion, and their zeale in preaching the truth and other vertues; yet hath our aduerſarie no reaſon to deſpiſe his owne nation, or to preferre the Spaniards before vs. For héere true religion without mixtures of poperie is embraced, and the ſame ſo generally taught, that none can be ignorant, but ſuch as like the adder, that ſtoppeth his eares, refuſe to heare Gods worde, and to vnderſtand the truth. The number of learned men among vs is greater, then among the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, proportion for proportion; neither to abridge this idle diſpute, ſhall <hi>N. D.</hi> finde, that our nation either in morall vertues, or naturall endowments, or ſupernaturall graces is inferior to the Spaniard, or ought to yéeld to him in any thing; ſaue in this, that hée hath better happe to encounter with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh traitors to flatter the Spaniſh nation, and we no Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, or fewe, that will take on them to ſet foorth our due praiſes.</p>
                     <p>It reſteth now that wée examine the particulars, of our aduerſaries pleading, according to the courſe which before wée haue propoſed to our ſelues. Not that any great matter doth reſult of the whole ſumme, but that wée may at the leaſt, gather a ſumme of our aduerſaries fooleries and trecherous purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of this laſt encounter hée<note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>P.</hi> 103.</note> telleth vs <hi>That there remaineth yet another bickering about the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh king and nation.</hi> Hée ſhoulde alſo haue told vs, againſt whom this bickering, made as it ſhoulde ſéeme by the ſhade<note n="b" place="margin">That is, of a glaſſe of wine.</note> 
                        <hi>d'vn bicchier di vino,</hi> is entended. but that is apparent by the diſcourſe enſuing. for it is wholy againſt his countrey and nation. So then, this champion commeth out in his Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ierkin, to fight for Spaniards, and againſt his owne nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. May we therefore (thinke you) ſafely truſt him, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth on him to ſpeake for publike enimies againſt the ſafetie and ſtate of his countrey and countrey people? Well let vs ſée what this champion hath to ſay for his clients.</p>
                     <p>Firſt hée<note n="c" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> ſaith, <hi>That a man muſt ſpeake moderately of his enimie, and that we muſt not lie, nor faine reproches, no not
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:177777:125"/> of the diuell himſelfe.</hi> So hee maketh a faire entrance into his matter, comparing the Spaniardes to the diuell: then which courſe nothing can be more reprochfull to his clients. Hée may be glad that the Spaniards vnderſtande him not. Otherwiſe they woulde make him know, that they are not to be compared to diuels. But to let that paſſe, and to grant, that a man muſt ſpeake moderately of his enimie, yea of the diuel; yet hath not hee obſerued that moderation in ſpeaking either of friendes or enimies. For hée flattereth his friends groſſely, and raileth againſt his enimie moſt odiouſly and deſpitefully. Nay hée raileth againſt his liege prince, and ſuch as haue ſhewed themſelues to be her moſt faithfull ſubiectes, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth her greateſt enimies, albeit if hée were a true man, hée woulde haue done neither.

                     <p>In this treatiſe, which wée haue now in hand, albeit hée
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:177777:126"/> ſéeme to profeſſe Warding and fenſing; yet hath he no fence to kéepe his toong from lying. And yet they ſay hée lieth verie cloſely; yea and falſely too. Such is his excellencie in both fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, that a great queſtion may be made, whether he raileth or lieth more impudently and ſtarkely. Do you not then take him to bée a fit man to giue precepts of modeſtie and true dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to others, that hath nor modeſtie, nor truth, nor reaſon in his owne dealing? And may he take vpon him to cenſure others for rayling, libelling, raging, lying and facing, that in lying and libelling hath ſurmounted, not onely <hi>Lucian</hi> and <hi>Rabelays,</hi> but alſo all his owne companions of the ſocietie of his firie father <hi>Ignatius?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for his aduerſarie, hée hath not ſpoken any thing, that in equall iudgement can be thought to ſauour of immodeſtie. For albeit hée ſeemeth to charge the Spaniards with <hi>Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and tyrannie,</hi> and ſaith, that they are <hi>Proud, ambitious, bloudie, rauening, and curſed of God:</hi> yet his intention was not to touch the whole nation, in which no doubt there are many ciuill, religious and honeſt men, and of great woorth, eſpecially when they come to the knowledge of the truth; but diuers of them indefinitely, and ſuch eſpecially, as came in the popes ſeruice, to execute his wrath and diſpleaſure againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Chriſtians. For againſt theſe doth hée direct his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and againſt them doth hée animate his countreymen to fight, ſéeing their purpoſe is to deſtroy our countrey, and with crueltie to eſtabliſh both a falſe religion, and an abſolute ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie. Neither coulde hée vſe more gentle termes, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the inſolencies of the Spaniſh forces in theſe caſes, and the tyrannie of their gouernment.

                     <p>But faith our fencing warder and bickerer, <hi>The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards are hated for their catholike religion eſpecially, and next for their virtue and valor.</hi> He ſaith alſo, that the like hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the Engliſh, when they were Lords of France for the moſt part; and to the Romaines, when they ruled a great part of the world.

Beſide that it is well knowne, that the Neapolitanes, Milaneſes and Portingals do not hate the Spaniards for their religion, but for the cauſes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly declared.

                     <p>How potent the country is, it may appeare by this, that it hath béene ſo often conquered by the Cathaginians, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, Gothes and Vandales, and laſtly by the Mores of Barbary. <hi>Theodoſius and Traian</hi> albeit borne in Spaine, were of Romaine bloud, &amp; brought vp in Italy and Rome. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> alſo and <hi>Lucan</hi> and <hi>Martiall</hi> had their learning and ſkill at Rome, albeit <hi>Martiall</hi> for his filthy and obſcene writing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth of the humor of ſome Spaniards.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo a matter of méere impudency, to compare the battels and conqueſtes of Spaniardes in the Indiaes, where they had to do onely with naked men, and people vnſkilfull in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:177777:127"/> feats of armes, to the actions of the Romaines, that haue ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the moſt warlike people of the worlde. Neither can wée account of his relation of winning of ſoules to Chriſt in the Indies by friers otherwiſe, then as of a lying legend, and vaine bragge, that hath no ground. For<note n="a" place="margin">Hierom. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo. &amp; Barth. Caſ.</note> diuers report, that they haue deſtroied millions of ſoules, and ſpeake ſparely of winning of ſoules. But were all this true, that is héere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, yet maketh the ſame nothing ſo much for the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, as the Noddie imagineth. For what auaileth it to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe a fertile and good countrey, and which is praiſed in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, vnleſſe the inhabitants bée good and vertuous? Spaine, I trow, is not better then the land of Canaan, that flowed with milke and hony, yet were the people excéeding wicked. What commendation is it, to bée deſcended of a nation, that hath had many religious Chriſtians, conſtant martyrs, iuſt and wiſe princes, valiant ſoldiers and captaines, vnleſſe the Spaniards continue in the ſteps of their anceſtors? But that now the Spaniards are like their aunceſtors, this declamer durſt not ſay. Nay it may very well bée ſaide, that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Spaine now are not deſcended of the Spaniards that were either in <hi>Traians</hi> &amp; <hi>Theodoſius</hi> his time, or in the daies of <hi>Iſidorus</hi> and <hi>Leander.</hi> Nor haue they the religion, or zeale of the ancient Spaniards. But ſaith the Ward-worder, <hi>God in regard and recompence of other rare vertues, will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don other infirmities and defects.</hi> Hée auoucheth alſo that God <hi>hath aduanced the Spaniards aboue other nations of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope for the defence of Catholike religion.</hi> So it appéereth by his owne confeſſion, that the Spaniards his clients want not ſinnes and faultes (hée calleth them onely infirmities <hi>Peccadillos,</hi> and defects) but all their enormous ſinnes, as hée ſuppoſeth, are couered by their zeale in the popes ſeruice. A verie excellent péece of doctrine. If the Spaniard commit moſt heinous murders, and rauage whole countries, and liue moſt filthily, and blaſpheme Gods holy word neuer ſo execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie; yet by this mans diuinitie they neede not feare, if they maintaine the popes cacolike religion, and murder all that are ſtudious of peace and Chriſts truth. Let them go to father <hi>Parſons,</hi> and hee will abſolue them, and ſet them toll frée, that they ſhall not pay any thing to the pope. But what if they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne catholike religion and murder Gods ſaints? Then the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:177777:128"/> caſe is altred, and the Warder hath no fence for them, nor for ſuch offences. Nay hée cannot denie, but as their faith is he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical and ſuperſtitious; ſo their ſins are great and enormous. The Spaniards therefore woulde be aduiſed not to truſt this falſe frier too farre. Zeale is commendable: but then it muſt be ioyned with knowledge. It is no Chriſtian zeale that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth men to kill poore chriſtians. Our Sauiour Chriſt ſent his diſciples to teach the Gentiles, and not to kill them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did <hi>Peter</hi> kill the Gentiles and ſinners, that were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the truth, albeit in a viſion he was<note n="a" place="margin">Act. <hi>10.</hi> macta &amp; manduca.</note> commaunded to kill and eate: but ſought by preaching to conuert them from their wicked liues, to the truth of Chriſt Ieſus. But the pope and his adherents the Spaniards auert many from the truth, conuert none to the truth; kill the body with the ſworde, and deſtroy the ſoule with corrupt doctrine, runne into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies vpon pretence of winning ſoules, and yet neglect the Turkes, Mores, and Iewes, that are hard at their doores. And all this is commended in them by our aduerſarie. Nay he ſéemeth to teach, that ſinners, that are out of the ſtate of grace can merite remiſſion of ſinnes, and that the Spaniards for murdring of Chriſtians, ſhall bée pardoned for other ſinnes, which they commit. But be it hée ſhoulde onely ſay, that a man, that ſhoulde zealouſly adhere to the truth, ſhoulde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by purchaſe remiſſion of other ſinnes; yet is not this iuſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For wée being out of grace are dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnnes, and Chriſt onely can purchaſe remiſſion of ſinnes, which without faith cannot be applied to vs.</p>
                     <p>Finally he is not aſhamed to confeſſe, <hi>That in times paſt our anceſters were neere linked to the Spaniard in loue, leagues and allyance betwixt the princes of both the nations: and that at this tyme the Spaniardes ſhew great kindeneſſe to papiſtes fled beyond the ſeas.</hi> But little doth this make to the purpoſe, and leſſe for the commendation of the Spaniard. For it is not here called in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what hath paſſed betwixt the natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but whether the Spaniard hath ſo rare partes in him, that he is to be preferred before all other nations, and before the Engliſh eſpecially: which is no way to be deduced or decided by this diſcourſe concerning leagues and allyances. Againe if we were ſo néere linked and conioyned together, as our aduerſary talketh, and that to the profite and honor of both the nations;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:177777:128"/> what reaſon had the Spaniardes at the ſolicitation of that bald frier <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> to fall out with their ould friendes, and to treate with our moſt malicious enimies? What can they alledge, why without all iuſt cauſe, they ſhould both by force and practiſes oppugne our nation, that neuer offered them wrong? Had they not thereby hazarded the loſſe of the low countries, if her Maieſty would haue accepted them béeing offered vnto her? And haue they not opened a way for the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing ſome part of the Indiaes as oft, as it ſhall pleaſe the princes of this land to eſtabliſh a courſe for the mainteinance of the trade into thoſe countries? And albeit we haue omitted to take the aduantage of either of theſe two courſes; yet there is no time paſt, but her Maieſtie may alwaies take the one, and percaſe haue opportunity to make benefit of the other. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally if the Spaniardes had remembred the ould friendſhip, that hath paſſed betwixt both nations, they would not haue abetted traytors to rebell, nor receited rebelles, that are fled out of the realme for feare of lawes, albeit they pretend reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                     <p>After the defence of the Spaniſh nation in generall our warder with his guard of looſe wordes deſcendeth to ſpeake of king <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond in particular. A man now dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and therefore the rather to be ſpared, although while he liued he was a heauy enemy to our whole nation. Yet for as much as our aduerſary hired percaſe to pronounce a funerall diſcourſe in his praiſe, doth ſo commend him, as he ſticketh not to touch the honor of our nation ſomeway entangled with his croſſe dealings; I thought it not amiſſe to conſider what this exorbitant frier hath to ſay either for king <hi>Philip,</hi> whome he rayſeth out of his graue, purpoſing percaſe to enſhrine him for a ſaint, or againſt the Engliſh nation, which he hateth more deadly, then doth the Spaniard.</p>
                     <p>Firſt hée is offended that king <hi>Philip</hi> ſhoulde bée termed <hi>Proud, ambitious, falſe, cruell, trecherous, tyrannicall,</hi> and ſuch like: and ſaith that <hi>If any of the kings ſubiectes were to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere ſir Francis, he woulde giue him the lie and challenge him into the field.</hi> As if the kings ſubiects were ſuch dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous men, as none durſt maintaine an honeſt quarrell againſt them; or as if they were more terrible <hi>Rodomontes</hi> among the Spaniardes, then otherwhere. Well ſéeing theſe challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:177777:129"/> come not forth, we ſhall eaſily iuſtifie Sir <hi>Francis</hi> his charge againſt this frierlike combatants rude and vnciuill cauils and wrangling. For it was no part of Sir <hi>Francis</hi> his meaning ſimply to charge king <hi>Philip</hi> with any matter fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then concerned the cauſe in hand, and further then the king, taking vpon him to be the <hi>Popes champion,</hi> perſecuted poore Chriſtians with great iniuſtice and cruelty. And vſing the pretence of popiſh religion ſought both by force of armes, and fraudulent practiſe to vſurpe the dominions of other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to eſtabliſh a tyranny among ſuch people, as by armes he had oppreſſed. Hereupon let the world iudge, whether Sir <hi>Francis</hi> had not reaſon to exhort all true Engliſh to oppoſe themſelues againſt ſuch ambition, pride, vſurpation, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous practiſe, iniuſtice, cruelty and tyranny, and whether any man in ſuch a caſe could haue ſaid leſſe. But if he had ſaid more, yet the kinges ſtrange procéedinges againſt his ſonne <hi>Charles,</hi> teſtyfied by pope<note n="a" place="margin">Vita Pij <hi>5.</hi> Girol. Cat.</note> 
                        <hi>Pius</hi> himſelfe: againſt his wiues; complained of by the French: againſt the prince of Orenge, and the people of the low countries recorded in the actes of the Duke of Alua, and teſtyfied by diuers apologies of the prince of Orenge and the ſtates, and knowne to many yet liuing: againſt his ſubiectes of Naples and Milan, reported in Nata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis Comes, and diuers hiſtories: againſt the Portingals wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by the hiſtorie of the conqueſt of Portugal, by <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio</hi> the king wrongfully diſpoſſeſſed of his country and beſt knowne to the Portingals: againſt the Quéene of England knowne to the world, and recorded in the proceſſe againſt <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pez</hi> the phyſicion, and partly teſtyfied by <hi>Gierome Catena</hi> in the life of <hi>Pius Quintus;</hi> againſt the ſecretarie <hi>Eſcouedo,</hi> and <hi>Antonio Perez,</hi> and the ſtate of Arragon publiſhed to the world in a treatiſe for that purpoſe: theſe procéedings (I ſay) and his whole life recorded in hiſtories, would ſufficiently iuſtifie the ſame. Againſt which recordes, and teſtifications the idle talke of this addleheaded Noddy <hi>Concerning his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike maieſties oppoſite vertues, of his ſweete nature and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, of his princely behauiour &amp; pious gouernement,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth neither credite, nor conſideration.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:177777:129"/> lodging were neuer ſo ſwéetely perfumed. So excellent a thing it is to bée ſwéete natured. Hée ſaith alſo, <hi>That by the witneſſe of enuy king Philip is cleered.</hi> Percaſe hée himſelfe in this frierlike declamation degorged in the kings praiſe taketh on him the perſon of enuie, and ſo cléereth him. Otherwiſe all the water in the baie of Alcaſſon woulde neither waſh him, nor cléere him.</p>
                     <p>Where ſir <hi>Francis</hi> doth obiect to king <hi>Philip</hi> certaine dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous practiſes héere in England, during his mariage with Quéene <hi>Marie:</hi> this idle diſcourſer not remembring his title of Warde-word, leaueth his garde, and runneth into a néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe diſcourſe <hi>Of the ſtate of things in Queene Maries time, while the Spaniards were in England.</hi> As if it were in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what was then done in England, and not how king <hi>Philip</hi> caried himſelfe in Spaine, and all other places; or elſe, as if the ſtate of thinges in England concerned king <hi>Philips</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and qualities any thing at all. Well let vs notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſee, what this idle iangler hath to ſay for the ſtate of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in England.</p>
                     <p>Hée ſaith firſt, <hi>That king Philip paide the expences and for the furniture of the mariage with Queene Marie: and how the two Spaniſh and Engliſh nauies, that accompanied the king, when hee came into England were at his coſt, vntill they came to Porteſmouth, and the whole traine from thence to Wincheſter, and that the mariage was celebrated at his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> But what is this to the diſcharge of his promiſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the relation of the ſtate of England? Beſides that, this narration is full of vanitie and falſhoode. For what is more vaine, then to bragge that the king defraid the charges of his ſeruants, and attendants, or that hée paid the charges of his owne mariage? What more conſonant, then that the huſband and goodman of the houſe ſhoulde bee at the charge of his wife and houſhold? What a ridiculous thing is it to vaunt, that the king paide all charges betwéene Porteſmouth and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, when either little or nothing was ſpent in the iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney? The falſhood of his narration may be controlled by the accounts, that are yet to bée ſeene in the auditor generals of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and in the Eſchequer. For thereby it is apparent, that the Queene not onely defraied the charge of her owne fléete, but alſo ſpent infinitlie about the furniture and preparations

                        <pb n="210" facs="tcp:177777:131"/> for her mariage. Money certes euill beſtowed. For neuer was mariage more vnhappie either to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince her ſelfe, or her ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Secondly hée telleth, <hi>That the Spaniſh nobles and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men came furniſhed with neceſſities and money.</hi> It is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell he ſetteth not downe alſo, how they came furniſhed with Moriſcoes and Negroes, and horſeboies, and ſuch <hi>Canalliary.</hi> All which pertaine as much to the purpoſe, as that which hée ſetteth downe of the nobles and gentlemen. But bée it they came well furniſhed, yet that deſerueth no great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. As for their expences they could not be great, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt did eate vpon the Quéenes charge, and the reſt ate bread by the ounce, and drunke water by the quart: and yet all of them coulde not auoide to come in merchants bookes.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly hée ſaith, <hi>That the priuie councell was not altered by the king.</hi> As if that were not a point following vpon the conditions of the mariage. Beſide that, albeit he altered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet through the ſubtiltie of Wincheſter, the Councell was at his deuotion: and ſhoulde no doubt haue béene altered, but that he was preuented by the Quéenes death.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly he vaunteth much <hi>That he honored the Engliſh Nobilitie, and gaue many of them great penſions.</hi> But hée ſhoulde do well to name thoſe, that were ſo honored, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched by king <hi>Philip.</hi> For it is more then I can learne. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it is no ſtrange matter, if for to effect his purpoſes, he was at ſome expence. For fiſhers when they angle for fiſh muſt bée at the charge of the baite; and fowlers, that ſéeke to catch birdes, muſt draw them to their nets by caſting them meate. Like vanitie he vſeth where hée ſheweth, <hi>That the king ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored highly Engliſh captaines and ſoldiers, and made them equall in all points of ſeruice with the Spaniard.</hi> As if it were a high point of honor for Engliſh to bée made equall with Spaniards. Beſide that, all the honor the king did them, was to ſuffer their throtes to bée cut in the ſacke of Saint Quintin, and the ſeruice ended, to ſend them home poore, bare, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Hée affirmeth alſo, <hi>That the king made our merchants free to enioy all priuiledges throughout all his kingdome.</hi> Which is a plaine and moſt notorious vntruth. For neither were they ſuffered to trade into the Indies, nor had any more priuiledge in Spaine &amp; the Low countries, then méere ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as is euident by the merchants bookes now to be ſhewed,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:177777:131"/> if néede bée. It is alſo a méere fable, <hi>That the king in all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels betwixt Engliſh and Spaniards ſhoulde fauor the Engliſh, &amp; that this ſhould coſt the Queene many a bitter teare.</hi> Let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quarels be ſpecified, &amp; witneſſes produced to prooue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quéenes tenderneſſe more to Spaniards, then her owne people.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly hée telleth a very pitifull caſe, <hi>viz. That no Spaniard coulde walke in the night without danger of his life, nor at other times without iniurious wordes; and that they paide deere for all things, eſpecially if they were taken talking with a mans wife, daughter, or ſeruant: and, as a certaine Viceroy tolde him,</hi> that <hi>ſome Engliſh would ſend their wiues &amp; daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of purpoſe into the fieldes, where Spaniards walked, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure them to talke with them, and thereby to entrappe them, and get money from them:</hi> and that <hi>diuers of the Spaniardes had their purſes taken from them, &amp; that the Count Fuenſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da was robbed, as he was at ſupper with diuers of his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> All which long diſcourſe is as farre from the purpoſe, as Spaine from England. For what doth this concerne king <hi>Philips</hi> vertues, or the ſtate of England, which are the points which héere he taketh on him to handle? Muſt the ſtate of England conſiſt now in the brabbles betwixt the ſcum of the kings traine and a fewe bandes and baſe fellowes, about their <hi>Sen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>oras?</hi> Further the ſame doth rather ſhewe the inſolency of the Spaniards, then deſerue any commiſeration for the loſſes or knockes they priuily receiued. For why ſhoulde they be ſuffred to abuſe honeſt women, or to attempt maidens cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie? Will <hi>N. D.</hi> our Warder play the baud to make mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches betwixt knaues and whoores, and miſlike that there was not a guard ſet, while ſuch lend fellowes went about their baſe affaires? Againe it may be, that it was not a Viceroy (for what hath ſuch a Noddy or vice, as this, to do with Viceroies, or viceroies to do with ſuch petite matters) but ſome vice that purpoſed to delude him, that tolde him the tale of theſe wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or walking knaues. For how could he know, that they were mens wiues or daughters, if he were a ſtranger; or elſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were ſent for that purpoſe that he ſpeaketh, into the fields? how knew he, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was a quarrell betwixt knaues &amp; bauds? how knew he, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spaniards did not willingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow their mony vpon baggages, being men that frequent the bordell, as oft as the church? As for the robbery of the Count
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:177777:132"/> 
                        <hi>Fuenſalida,</hi> if any ſuch thing were, it no more concerneth the honor of our nation, then the robberies by <hi>Fuoruſciti</hi> in Italy &amp; Naples y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honor of the king of Spaine. Robberies &amp; diſorders wil euery where be committed: but we praiſe them not, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not. Neither did Quéene <hi>Marie</hi> then allow this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid robberie. And rather then the old Count ſhould wéepe for his plate, he ſhall haue a collection in part of reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence for his loſſes. All this great matter therefore being well conſidered is nothing: neither hath our aduerſarie any reaſon to exclaime and ſay, <hi>That theſe were the fine fruites of our new Goſpell, then freſhly planted among vs.</hi> For thoſe that did theſe feates were papiſts, and not men of our religion, and theſe diſorders were committed in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> time, when popery was publikely profeſſed in England, and not in the time of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Againe, the Spaniards, and not any of our profeſſion, vſed to haunt bordels, and to make theſe baudy matches. And if in ſtates, that profeſſe the Goſpell there be diuers out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages committed; they cannot bée imputed to our profeſſion, but to the leudneſſe of thoſe, that will not bée reformed; and that liue among vs, and are not of vs. Which kinde of people are both reprooued by their teachers, and puniſhed by the magiſtrates.</p>
                     <p>Hauing thus for his pleaſure ranged farre from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in an idle diſcourſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning certaine brabbles betwixt the Engliſh and Spaniſh in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> daies, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to his purpoſe concerning king <hi>Philip:</hi> and gladly would he purge him from all ſuſpicion of euill meaning towards our nation, contrary to a letter mentioned by Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> and written out of Spaine, when king <hi>Philip</hi> was yet in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. The letter purported, that notwithſtanding the kings faire pretenſes, his purpoſe was to winne the fauour of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and ſo to make himſelfe abſolute king, and poſſeſſing the principall places with his owne ſouldiers, to alter the lawes, and to impoſe taxes, and rule the country at his pleaſure. And this the warder by all meanes ſéeketh to ſhift off, and to diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite: and that firſt, <hi>Becauſe theſe plots and practiſes were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard of before,</hi> as he ſaith. But he muſt néedes be deafe, that liued in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> daies in any eminent place in the ſtate, that heard not often of theſe practiſes; and very dull and ſenceleſſe, if he ſuſpected them not. Neither is it likely, that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:177777:132"/> ſuch a prince would deſire to come hither, if he ſhould ſtill be ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with conditions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly he ſaith, <hi>That the name of the writer and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of the letter would haue beene ſet downe.</hi> But that might haue bred daunger, the letter béeing written againſt Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes, that then ruled in England. Neither is it the faſhion for intelligencers to declare either their owne names, or the names of ſuch as they write vnto.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly he would auoide it by this ſhift, <hi>That it was ſome flying report, without ground, and taken vp in ſome port-towne or tauerne, by ſome factor, or other wandring compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> But the probability of the plot, and procéeding of the Spanyard, and the euent of thinges did ſhewe the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly he would beare vs in hand, <hi>That it was ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe to make the Spaniards odious, and perhaps to vphould the faction of the earle of Deuonſhire, that miſſing the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Queene Mary began to practiſe.</hi> But the ambition, and malicious purpoſe of the Spaniardes againſt all that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the truth, and his procéedings in the gouernement did plainely declare, that it was a truth, and no fiction. As for the earle of Deuonſhire he neuer deſired to marry the Quéene. For if he had, he might. Such was her affection towards him. Neither did he euer take any gréefe for not marrying her. for his affection was no way enclined that way. Neither could he poore gentleman entertaine any practiſe, béeing deſtitute of friends and meanes, &amp; watched by his enemies, &amp; of no ſubtill reache to compaſſe any ſuch matter. I wonder the Noddy was not aſhamed once to name this yong earle, who albeit inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and harmeleſſe, yet was poyſoned at Padua to content ſome mens humors. But our aduerſarie, as if he were a ſmith and of Vulcans generation, as his ſuppoſed father was, canne forge twentie ſuch deuiſes: and ſhift off wicked practiſes, with a number of looſe wordes. He ſaith, <hi>It is a grieuous and heinous ſlander againſt a mightie, munificent, and bountifull monarke, to ſay, that he meant to make himſelfe king.</hi> As if mighty and munificent monarkes do not in their ambitious humors ſéeke to enlarge their dominions. That this was no fiction, it may appeare by the drift of <hi>Charles</hi> the fift entending this mariage; by the popes demandes to the king, that could not be effected
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:177777:133"/> without greater authority; by the propoſitions made by king <hi>Philip</hi> to the counſell to enlarge his power, and releaſe the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the conditions, whereto he was tyed; by the kings ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret working to draw ouer Spaniſh ſoldiers, and his practiſes to poſſeſſe himſelfe of the nauy, and the principall portes and fortreſſes of this kingdome; by wordes commonly giuen out; by the teſtimony of Sir <hi>Francis Englefeld,</hi> if he were aliue and would ſay truth, and alſo of diuers others of the nobility; by the ambitious humors of the Spaniard; and finally for that otherwiſe his aduancement by this mariage would haue amounted to nothing. And if in the low countries, where he is but duke, or earle, he hath ſought to be an abſolute king; we may not doubt of his purpoſe in England, where he had the title of king, and poſſeſſed the Quéene.</p>
                     <p>Where the letter ſaith, <hi>That king Philip meant to haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the counſell, to poſſeſſe the hauens, to make new fortes, to furniſh them with his owne men, to change the common lawes, to bring in the Spaniſh inquiſition and Spaniſh lawes, and to impoſe ſtrange taxes vpon vs, after the faſhion of Spaine:</hi> he thinketh it ſufficient to anſwere firſt, <hi>That no ſuch thing was attempted by him;</hi> and ſecondly <hi>That all this was prouided for in the conditions of his mariage with the Queene.</hi> But his ſlender ſurmiſes are all too weake to croſſe ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent purpoſes. For albeit béeing preuented by the hand of God, that tooke away the Quéene, he could not put matters in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; yet doth it not follow, that he neuer had any ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or intention. Againe, it is a fond thing to imagine that the king could be tyed with wordes and conditions, when experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth vs, that neither promiſes, nor othes, nor lawes of God, nor lawes of nations could bridle his ambition. He was<note n="a" place="margin">Guicciardin. de paeſi baſſi.</note> preciſely ſworne, to obſerue the priuiledges, and lawes of the low countries. Yet did he obſerue none; but contrary to all order change the councell of eſtate, bring in the inquiſition, and enlarge the authority of the eccleſiaſticall ſtate, erect cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delles place garriſons, and impoſe ſtrange taxes vpon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And if the Duke of Alua did this by his direction in the low countries; no doubt, but he would haue doone the ſame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in England, if he had atteined his purpoſe, and had not béene croſſed by the Quéenes death. And that this was his full intention, we haue already ſhewed by diuers argumentes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:177777:133"/> the teſtimony of the letter. Theſe therefore are no bugges, nor imaginations; but true collections grounded vpon prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of ſtate, and the kings actions. Héereby alſo we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we were happily deliuered from the thraldome of the Spaniard, more grieuous then the thraldome of Egypt, as their rigorous dealing with them of the low countries may plainely enforme vs.</p>
                     <p>Where among ſtrange taxes impoſed by the Spaniards, one is mentioned moſt ſtrange, <hi>That the ſubiect payeth for euery chimney;</hi> and others are noted as not common, that ſome pay by the poll; and all pay for their victuals, ſo that a man cannot eat but the king muſt be paid, as if he were a common hoſt (as indéede he kéepeth a common tauerne in his court after a baſe faſhion, that a man cannot drinke, but the king will gaine ſomewhat) our aduerſarie wondreth, <hi>That any ſhould publiſh ſuch childiſh toyes.</hi> But the Spaniardes and the kings ſubiects in other places do find, that the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens are ſo heauy, that neither children, nor yet men are able to beare them. And albeit there is (percaſe) ſome error in the particulars, yet the ſum is not much miſtaken. For through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the kings dominions a tribute or taxe is paid for all things bought and ſould in the market. Neither is any marchandiſe exported, or brought into the country, or paſſed from place to place, but there is a cuſtome paid. Of late there is a tribute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted not onely for euery <hi>Hanega</hi> of corne ground at the mill, but alſo for ſalt. Neither are the countries of Biſcay, Arragon, Nauarre, Catalonia, or Valentia ſo frée, as our aduerſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth. In Flanders according to the Spaniſh ſtile, the duke of Alua impoſed a tenth and twentieth part vpon all the kings ſubiectes: a tribute neuer exacted in the Turkiſh dominions. Now then if the king exact ſuch payments vpon his owne frée ſubiectes; in what caſe are they like to be, that he ſhall van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh with his ſword?</p>
                     <p>Where it is declared in the letter, <hi>That the king purpoſed to roote out the nobility of England, and to bring the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to beggery; and to ſell all not aboue twentie yeeres ould for ſlaues:</hi> our aduerſary doth terme this narration <hi>ſottiſh and impudent;</hi> and aſketh, <hi>How this beeing contriued in England could be diſcouered by one in Spaine.</hi> But whatſoeuer termes the relation doth deſerue, certaine it is, that this manner of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:177777:134"/> procéeding is moſt inhumane and barbarous; and not ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, as the warder would make it. For firſt we may not thinke, that the haughty minde of the Spaniard could either be content with a ſimple reuenge of wrongs, or conteined within the boundes of common lawes and cuſtomes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly we know, that the popes malice is ſo great againſt ſuch as ſpurne at his authority, that he ſtirreth vp all the world againſt them, and <hi>Giueth them for ſlaues to thoſe, that canne take them,</hi> as<note n="a" place="margin">Sander. de ſchiſm. lib. <hi>1.</hi>

                        <hi>Paule</hi> the third did giue the Engliſh in <hi>Henry</hi> the eight his daies. Thirdly it is moſt notorious, that in the Indiaes they haue practiſed all theſe barbarous cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo that they haue almoſt diſpeopled diuers countries, that were very ful of people at their firſt comming thither. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the example of our neighbours of the low countries, that liue vnder the Spaniſh yoke, and haue their nobility eyther extinct or debaſed, and their liberties aboliſhed, and liue in great ſlauery, may ſhew vs ſome part of their purpoſes, and as it were the plot of their gouernement. Laſtly in their fléete that came againſt vs anno. 1588. beſide ſtore of halters and fetters prouided to bind our poore countrymen, that ſhould be taken priſoners, and were already taken in conceit, there were found in <hi>Don Pedro de valdez</hi> his ſhip diuers engines and irons to marke ſuch, as ſhould be taken, for ſlaues. Adde héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the teſtimony of him that wrote the letter out of Spaine mentioned by Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> and did vnderſtand by good intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence the reſolution of the Spaniards in this point, and wée ſhall not néede to make queſtion, but that this was indéed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and reſolued againſt our nation. Neither coulde hée reueale this ſecret, vnleſſe it had come to his notice: which might by diuers meanes come to paſſe. For albeit the king hatched this purpoſe firſt within his owne breſt; yet was the ſame communicated to others, and ſo made knowne in Spain to thoſe, that ſhoulde concurre in the execution of it. Such abominable treaſons God would not haue kept ſecret.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly where it is ſaide, <hi>That the king had laide a plot for the deſtruction of the Ladie Elizabeth now Queene of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> hée anſwereth, <hi>That the worlde knoweth, that the king at that day was her chiefe ſtay and defence; and that for the reaſons before alleaged, and that finding her when he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England in priſon, and hardly preſſed about Wyats inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:177777:134"/> hee deliuered her, and brought her to the court, and yeelded her moſt carefull protection.</hi> In the end hée con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, <hi>That it is barbarous ingratitude, not to acknowledge his fauour towards her.</hi> But if this were a matter knowne to the worlde, it were a great woonder, if it ſhoulde neuer bée knowne in England, where men haue greateſt reaſon to know the ſame. No, no: hée abuſeth his Reader very much, that, imputeth the cauſe of her ſafetie to king <hi>Philip.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit for ſome cauſes hée had reaſon to reſpect her then, when he hoped to haue iſſue by Quéene <hi>Mary;</hi> yet afterward, no doubt, hée conſulted (and that for many and potent conſiderations) to bée ridde of her. Yea albeit her innocencie in <hi>Wyats</hi> cauſe was ſufficiently knowne; yet if God almightie had not béene her chéefe protector, and ſtirred vp meanes for her ſafetie, neuer thought of by man; it was not the kings fauour, that coulde haue defended or deliuered her. But ſuppoſe God ſhoulde vſe the king likewiſe for an inſtrument of her deliuerance; yet did hée neuer any thing in regard of the Ladies innocencie, but rather in regard of his owne profite, as the Noddy vnawares confeſſeth in his third encounter, and as is very apparent by the procéedinges of the king in that action. But what if the king ſhoulde do a fauour to any perſon, is it barbarouſneſſe for all others, not to acknowledge the ſame? In ancient time thoſe that receiued a benefite, were déemed vnthankefull, if they did not acknowledge the ſame, and endeuor to requite it; but our barbarous Warder will haue all condemned for bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and vngratefull, that either know not, or acknowledge not the kings fauour extended to others. Other points of his anſwere, I haue before touched and refuted.</p>
                     <p>The premiſſes conſidered he doth woonder, <hi>How ſir Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis his booke</hi> (which hée termeth a libell) <hi>could bee ſuffred to paſſe to the print, eſpecially conteining ſo reprochfull calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niations againſt ſo great and potent a prince, as the king of Spaine is.</hi> But rather it is to bée woondred, that <hi>Parſons,</hi> or any Ieſuite ſhoulde once open their mouth to ſpeake of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniations and libels, when their common courſe is by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and ſlandrous writings to denigrate all ſuch as oppoſe themſelues to their factious courſes. <hi>Parſons</hi> is not onely a practitioner, but alſo hath paſſed maſter in this facultie.

As for ſir <hi>Francis Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings</hi> Watch-word, it is a diſcourſe of another nature, contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning neither ſatyricall inuectiue, nor iniurious calumniation, but a iuſt accuſation and declaration of our enimies moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and malicious purpoſes againſt vs: which none can miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, but ſuch, as profeſſe themſelues either enimies to our nation, or traitors to their prince.</p>
                     <p>In the end of this diſcourſe hée goeth about to cléere king <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond <hi>Of all ſupicion of hiring Lopez to poiſon her Maieſtie, yea of being priuie and conſenting to that execrable fact.</hi> But hée doth his client no pleaſure in mentioning that, wherewith hée is not charged, and refuting the charge ſo looſely, as if hée were hired to betray the kings cauſe; as hée hath héeretofore long gone about to betray his prince &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Wée, I ſay, do not charge the king with any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but onely referre our ſelues to <hi>Lopez</hi> his confeſſion, and to <hi>Manoel Lois,</hi> and <hi>Stephen Ferreiraes</hi> depoſitions, and to the bil of exchange for fifty thouſand crownes to be paid to <hi>Lopez.</hi> The witneſſes and parties do all blot the king, and his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall agents in the Low countries, the Count of <hi>Fuentes</hi> and <hi>Ibarra.</hi> Such a great ſumme coulde not bée paide without
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:177777:135"/> the kinges notice: héereto may bée added a certaine token or iewell ſent from <hi>Chriſtopher Moro</hi> the kings counſellor, and a meſſage from the king brought to <hi>Lopez</hi> by one <hi>Andrada.</hi> But nothing doth bréede more ſuſpicion, then this Noddies defence for the king. Hée ſaith, <hi>That this matter coulde neuer probably be knowne to the king.</hi> And why not? Coulde nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lopez</hi> himſelfe by letters, nor <hi>Andrada</hi> by meſſage, nor ſecretarie <hi>Ibarra</hi> tell him of the purpoſe? It is no queſtion. Nay it is confeſſed and depoſed that they did. Secondly hée ſaith, <hi>That Lopez neuer gaue any ſignification of any ſuch matter.</hi> But his confeſſion in writing teſtifieth the contrary. And many heard him ſay more then his confeſſion importeth. Thirdly hée alleageth, <hi>That the king was not to haue corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with Lopez being a Iew.</hi> As if the Spaniards vſe not to haue correſpondence both with Iewes and Turkes to ſerue their owne turnes; or if any coulde bée more fit to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute ſuch horrible factes, then Iewes and Infidels. Laſtly hée aſketh, <hi>If the king had no agents neere to plot ſuch matters, but he muſt be made priuy himſelfe.</hi> But it may bée anſwered, that no warrant coulde bée graunted for ſo great a ſumme, but by the king, that would not let fiftie thouſand crownes go for nothing: and that <hi>Lopez</hi> woulde do nothing, vnleſſe hée had the kings warrant both for the money and his further pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment. It is therefore no Turkiſh impietie, to talke of ſuch matters, but a courſe Turkiſh and heatheniſh or woorſe to do, or conſent to ſuch execrable empoiſonments. Neither would <hi>Parſons</hi> haue taken vpon him the defence of the king in this foule fact, if he had not béene of a Turkiſh humour. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo appéereth by a letter ſigned with his owne hand, where he confeſſeth that one of his owne conſorts doth charge him <hi>With tyrannicall, Turkiſh, and Machiuilian practiſes.</hi> And another prieſt in a letter reſembleth <hi>Dolmans booke of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Machiauels prince,</hi> making Machiaueliſme, and Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſme or Ieſuitiſme wordes of one ſignification, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Both ſignifie Turkied Atheiſme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſaith the Warder, <hi>It may bee doubted, whether any ſuch thing was entended by Lopez.</hi> It may bée alſo, that hee will doubt whether <hi>Lopez</hi> and his conſorts were publikely conuicted, and executed for that treaſon. For he is an infidell, as it ſhoulde ſéeme, and will beléeue nothing, but that which
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:177777:136"/> the pope deliuereth him to bée beléeued, and that maketh for the popes aduantage. And yet if hée had béene in <hi>Lopez</hi> his caſe, hée ſhoulde haue felt and touched with his finger, that all that was true, which now he will not beléeue.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore if he haue no further Warde to make for the Spaniardes and their late king; his fence will prooue woorth nothing. If hée haue no better argument to prooue the excellencie and renowne of the Spaniardes, then is contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this encounter, his clients will neuer thanke him; nor will any man take the old king for <hi>Catholike, pious, wiſe and potent,</hi> as hée oft termeth him, vnleſſe his proctor anſwere better for his faults, and bring better grounde for his exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant praiſes. Onely thus much hée hath gained, that men may ſée how with drinking good ſacke, hée is become Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. What good then may wée looke for at the hands of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enimie, and rinegate frier the popes ſworne ſlaue?</p>
                     <p>In the ende of his diſcourſe for a farewell hée putteth vs in ſome hope of peace betwéene both nations: but wée will then beléeue it, when wée ſée the conditions equall on both ſides, and ſufficient ſecuritie that they ſhall not breake their promiſe vpon the popes warrant. In the meane while we wil take the Spaniards as wée finde them; and make ready to receiue thoſe, that ſhall offer vs violence: and truſt ſuch, as vſe to kéepe promiſe.</p>

Not that I dare commend the worke as excellent, or perfect, but for that I thought it might bée a matter not vnprofitable for you to know, vnto what boldneſſe the Ieſuites and popiſh prieſts are come, and how neceſſarie it is to repreſſe their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious inſolencie, that with painted gloſſes, and glorious termes haue defended the actions, not onely of publike eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but alſo of moſt diſloyall traytors; and not onelie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage mal-contents, and ſtubborne ſubiectes in their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but alſo endeuor to diſgrace all thoſe, that ſhall dare to enterpriſe the defence of religion, of her Maieſtie, and the preſent gouernment. Nay albeit they take to themſelues li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to oppugne religion, and the ſtate, and vphold the cauſe of thoſe, that ſeeke the ruine of both; yet are they greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that any ſhoulde touch publike enimies, or miſlike theſe trecherous and diſloiall courſes. Yea ſuch is their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie, that they haue preſumed to addreſſe their pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets to your Honors, and to complaine to you, as if wée of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred them great wrong, when wée defend our ſelues againſt publike enimies, and traytors, and euill diſpoſed ſubiects; whereas themſelues wrong her Maieſtie and the ſtate, and wrangle againſt all honeſt men, that are ſtudious of truth and peace, and loyall to their prince and countrey. But this you ſhall perceiue the better, if as in the reſt of his encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo in this his concluſion and petition I note, not onelie the peruerſeneſſe and preſumption of this petitioner, but alſo the vanitie and abſurditie of his petition.</p>
                     <p>In his firſt entrance he offereth his diſcourſe <hi>To your view and iudgement.</hi> But preſently he excepteth againſt you, as if you were not equall, nor indifferent iudges. <hi>I cannot</hi>

                           <hi>P.</hi> 119.</note> ſaith he, <hi>expect to haue you equall iudges.</hi> Which is a courſe moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. For if he thought you not indifferent, why did he come before you? If he preſented his cauſe in good earneſt, why doth he refuſe you before hearing? Is this law among Ieſuites, to refuſe and appeale from arbitrators choſen by themſelues, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:177777:137"/> that before the cauſe be entred? Is not this notorious inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thus to ſcorne your Lorſhippes? Beſide that he is plaine contrary to himſelfe. For in the title of this concluſion, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth <hi>The whole anſwere to the iudgement, and arbitrement</hi> of your Lordeſhips. Here he draweth backe, and refuſeth you for his iudges. And yet, as if he had not refuſed you for iudges, he procéedeth in his pleading before you. Perhaps he meaneth to make you readers in ſtead of iudges, or ſuch iudges, as all readers are, which iudge what they like or diſlike themſelues, but giue no rule to others.</p>
                     <p>Well albeit he will not make you iudges <hi>Of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie it ſelfe;</hi> yet he is content you ſhould iudge <hi>of the manner of the proſequution thereof.</hi> So he will not haue you iudges, whether the pope and Spaniards are publike enemies, nor whether Ieſuites and prieſts fled out of England are traytors; nor whether papiſts are dangerous ſubiectes; nor finally whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are to arme our ſelues againſt forreine enimies, and beware of traytors and ſuſpected ſubiectes; which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie betwixt him and Sir <hi>Francis Haſtings,</hi> but in what termes we are to deale againſt enimies, and traytors, and their conſortes. Belike he meaneth to make your Lordſhips grammarians, for ſuch are fitteſt to iudge of words and phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: the controuerſie he telleth you plainely, you are not to meddle withall. I beléeue you haue not ſéene many ſuch ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliantes come before you: neither do I thinke, that a forme canne readily be found of ſuch a petition.</p>
                     <p>He ſaith, <hi>If the watchword had beene preſented to your Lordſhips, before it was printed, that it ſhould, as he thinketh, haue beene ſtopped or moderated.</hi> So he doth not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on your Lordſhips an office of iudicature, but alſo of watching of preſſes and correcting of bookes ſet out againſt Ieſuites: and albeit a baſe companion, yet is he bold to abuſe your Lordſhips and to make you miniſters of his pleaſures and purpoſes, that nothing may paſſe but formally, and to the Ieſuites good liking. For he is much offended, that any ſhould ſpeake either for truth, or ſtate againſt publike enemies and traytors, and would moſt earneſtly pray you, that you would be pleaſed to ſuffer him and his conſortes to vndermine the ſtate, and to ſtirre vp rebellion, and cut honeſt mens throtes without any noiſe, or queſtion made about the matter. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:177777:137"/> Sir <hi>Francis</hi> hath exhorted his countrymen couragiouſly to withſtand the Spaniards and other publike enimies, and ſpeaketh plainely, what we are to thinke of him and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſortes; he calleth him <hi>A troubleſome ſtickler,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>He is tranſported with violent rage againſt potent and annointed princes,</hi> and in diuers places chargeth him with railing and ſlandering, &amp; heere imputeth to him <hi>Baſe detractions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious fictions,</hi> and giueth him many other verie bigge words degorged out of his wicked and impotent malice againſt good men. As if it were not lawful for vs, to defend our ſelues, or touch our enemies, but in ſuch manner and forme, as this criticall Ariſtarchus, and new teacher of formes of ſpéech ſhall like. So ridiculous and abſurd a Noddy we do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, &amp; ſuch vnreaſonable requeſts we are to anſwere: as may further appeare by the ſequell of his diſcourſe.</p>

                     <p>This courſe would be dangerous to her Maieſty, and the ſtate. Now the pope béeing publikely hence excluded, hath not thoſe meanes to worke her Maieſtie diſpleaſure, as he hath to worke againſt princes in countries of his obedience, and ſhould haue héere, if popery might be tolerated. And this to be true, <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> in his bull publiſhed againſt her Maieſty anno 1588. and tranſlated by Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> doth himſelfe in plaine wordes teſtify. <hi>Not hauing</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in theſe parts the ordinary meanes, which by the aſſiſtance of Chriſtian princes we haue in other countries to remedy diſorders, and keepe the people in obedience, for that Henry the eight late king of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland did of late yeeres reuolt from the ſea apoſtolike.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it appeareth by the<note n="d" place="margin">Vita di Pio <hi>5.</hi> Girol. Catena.</note> example of the pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fiftes Nuntio <hi>Vincentio Lauro,</hi> who not daring to paſſe into Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to practiſe, but ſtaying at Paris, was depriued of meanes to effect his wicked purpoſe. Likewiſe the Ieſuites and prieſts not daring now publikely to ſhew themſelues, nor to deale with all perſons publikely and without danger, looſe many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to ſet forward the popes cauſe. The recuſantes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, though they come not to the church; yet hauing no liberty to conuerſe with Ieſuites, nor to learne their ſeditious doctrine, kéepe themſelues in better termes, then otherwiſe they would do, if it were lawfull for them to profeſſe their religion openly. But admit once Ieſuites and ſeminary prieſtes to reenter into the land, or to liue among vs; the pope firſt will haue more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie and meanes to worke his purpoſes. Neither is it likely, that he will euer deſiſt from proſequuting her Maieſty,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:177777:140"/> hauing by ſo many ſentences diſabled her, excommunicated her, and depoſed her. Secondly the Ieſuites and prieſts would haue better meanes both to peruert the ſimple, and to worke their treaſons againſt the prince, and her moſt loyall ſubiects. And if they do much hurt now, when they are reſtreined, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſuffered to liue in priſons; what would they do, if ſuch woolues were let looſe amongſt Chriſtes lambes? That they will alwaies be ready to execute the popes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt her Maieſtie, there is no queſtion, ſéeing they holde it damnation, not to obey him. Thirdly, the Recuſants hauing ſuch teachers, what woulde they not do, when <hi>Hall</hi> coulde perſwade <hi>Somerfield;</hi> and <hi>Ballard, Babington</hi> and ſo many gentlemen deſperately to aduenture to kill the Quéene?</p>
                     <p>How dangerous this may bée to good ſubiects we may conſider, if wée do but looke into their wooluiſh practiſes in France, and Flanders, and other where. Did not the papiſts of Orleans being admitted thither according to the edict after the firſt warres, murder thoſe of the true religion, and ſhut out the reſt? Did they not in all other places, as oft as they were the ſtronger, ſéeke to murder them? The matter is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and recorded in many hiſtories. Neither may wée thinke, wée ſhall better agrée with them héere, then others haue done in other places. Light and darkeneſſe, ſhéepe and woolues ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not agree togither. And albeit our doctrine will not ſuffer vs to perſecute papiſts, yet their doctrine teacheth them to kill vs. And that is their continuall practiſe.</p>
                     <p>Finally this petition is moſt vnreaſonable, in reſpect of the petitioners themſelues. They will not grant or procure our brethren libertie in Spaine and Italy; and yet they are ſo ſhameleſſe to aſke that, which they will not grant vs, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for vs otherwhere. Againe they deſire to liue vnder her Maieſtie, and yet they will not renounce her ſworne enimie, and his vſurped authoritie, nor acknowledge her to bée law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Quéene; although the pope do depoſe her. Nay they giue her enimie power ouer her, which by lawes of ſtate is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly they haue héeretofore ſhewed themſelues rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and factious. How ſhoulde wée then ſecure our ſelues, that they will behaue themſelues more loyally héereafter? Why ſhoulde wée thinke, that they will do otherwiſe, then
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:177777:140"/> the Iriſh rebels, that haue ſhaken off her Maieſties gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? They ſay they will behaue themſelues peaciblie: nay, percaſe they will not ſticke to ſweare it. But how ſhoulde wée beléeue either oathes, or promiſes, when they depend vpon the pope, that will ſuffer them to kéepe neither?</p>
                     <p>I conclude therefore, that to aſke a toleration of the maſſe and of popiſh religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is a matter impious, vnſafe for her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie and her people, and moſt vnreaſonable.

                        <hi>That would not receiue thoſe into their houſe, or bid them god ſpeede, that brought not with them Chriſtes true doctrine:</hi> to the authoritie of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; holy emperors and princes, that by no meanes could endure any idolatrous worſhip, or hereticall doctrine: to the cuſtome of the Romiſh ſynagogue, and the traditions of the pope and his<note n="e" place="margin">Poſſeuini bibliotheca ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecta lib. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>26.</hi>
                        </note> Iebuſites and Cananites, and finally to the lawes of the church and kingdome of England, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great conſideration are not to be diſſolued or ſuſpended. Neither can the ſame bée allowed by any good Chriſtian or loyall ſubiect, ſéeing it bringeth with it firſt an vncertaintie of faith and religion. ſecondly a confuſion in Gods worſhip. thirdly a diſſolution of eccleſiaſticall gouernment &amp; diſcipline. fourthly an ouerthrow of lawes and ciuill pollicie. fiftly an entrance for ſeditious prieſts and Ieſuites not tolerated eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where among the papiſts. ſixtly an eaſie meanes to practiſe againſt the prince and ſtate. ſeuenthly a coldneſſe in religion, eightly ſedition, trouble and rebellion. Laſtly the wrath of God, and moſt ſpéedie deſtruction. And that this is true, the very<note n="f" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> aduerſaries will not denie within the ſphere of their actiuitie, and in their owne gouernment. Why then ſhoulde they looke for that at our hands, which they will not yéeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelues? Or with what face can they deſire thinges ſo impious and vnlawfull?</p>
                     <p>Firſt ſaith our aduerſary, <hi>Great princes and monarchies round about vs that had greater difficulties and differences, then we haue.</hi> He ſhould haue ſaid <hi>Monarkes,</hi> and <hi>Neere vnto vs.</hi> For not monarchies but monarkes do treate of peace. And
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:177777:141"/> the kings of France and Spaine dwell not round about vs but néere vnto vs. But we muſt beare with our great aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry if talking of princes and ſtates, he forgot to vſe fit wordes or make good ſence. Beſide that, he is much deceiued where he ſaith, <hi>That they had greater differences &amp; difficulties in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of a peace,</hi> then we haue. For all ciuil cauſes may be compounded. But no compoſition can be made with falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or idolatry. Againe kinges may agrée concerning tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall titles, but we cannot agrée with the pope or his faction, vnleſſe we meane to forſake God and the true Chriſtian faith. Well let vs ſée notwithſtanding what <hi>Theſe great princes and monarchies round about vs haue doone. They haue</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>concluded a moſt honourable peace and friendſhip.</hi> And I will not deny, but it may be ſo, albeit diuers ſmall accidentes may much alter the caſe. But what maketh that for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, where it is debated, whether the idolatrous maſſe is to be tolerated, or any other courſe to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with Engliſh fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, and home-bred papiſtes? If we might haue an honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, profitable and moſt aſſured peace, it is the thing that we do much affect and deſire, neuer proſequuting warres but for our owne defence and ſafety. But what is this peace héere ſpoken of to the toleration of ſeditious prieſts, and Ieſuites and ſuch rebels and traytors? Can wée haue no peace, but by ſuffering of exiled and baniſhed rebels and traytors to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne?

Why then ſhould he talke of peace and friendſhip héere? Therefore he telleth further, <hi>How the French king is returned to the ſea of Rome, and that her Maieſty is courteouſly inuited to the ſame.</hi> And is this the onely meanes of peace? Sure then any warre is better, then ſuch a peace. For if wée reſpect one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temporall matters, yet to yéeld to a tyrant, is the laſt, and moſt extreme calamity, that happeneth to a natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vanquiſhed and ſubdued: and no prince can put himſelfe vnder another, but he giueth ouer his ſoueraignty. Beſide that, ſuppoſe her Maieſty ſhould yéeld to the pope, which without indignation cannot be ſpoken, nor yéelded vnto by any true Engliſh man;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:177777:141"/> how is ſhe ſure, that ſhe ſhall either reteine, or recouer her crowne, he hauing diſabled her, and diſpoſſeſſed her of it? Shall ſhe begge a crowne at his handes? Shall ſhe do penance at his pleaſure? Will ſhe abandon her ſelfe and her ſubiectes to ſuch a baſe fellow? Fye fye, that any ſhould be ſuffered once to motion ſuch a ſhamefull and an abominable matter. But if we reſpect religion, truth, and conſcience: we cannot ſubmitte our ſelues vnto him; we cannot acknowledge his authority: we may not embrace his abominable doctrine and hereſies, whatſoeuer may enſue of it. Hée is the head of antichriſtes kingdome, and the ſynagogue of Rome is the purple whoore mentioned in the ſeuentéenth of the Reuelation of ſaint <hi>Iohn.</hi> His whooriſh allurements to idolatrie and hereſie wée value not. And if this bée meanes of peace, and no other; then wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come warres, nay welcome rather death. For who had not rather endure ten thouſand deathes, then die the ſecond death, and kill his owne ſoule? Our aduerſarie ſaith that her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie hath béene inuited curteouſly to come to the pope. But we thinke it ſtrange curteſie to ſtirre vp rebels againſt her; to curſe her; to hire deſperate cutthrotes to murder her and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſon her. But were ſhée inuited curteouſly, yet ſimple are the birdes that ſuffer themſelues to be taken at the foulers call. <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> heard the Sirenes ſongs, but hée would not come néere them. As for the French kinges example, it is not to purpoſe. Hée to winne a kingdome might do as it pleaſed him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if her Maieſtie ſhoulde ſo do; ſhée ſhoulde hazard that kingdome, which ſhée poſſeſſeth already quietly, rather then winne one poore towne or hamlet. Nay ſhée ſhoulde hazard her ſoule. Beſide that, her Maieſtie is rather to follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of godly kinges, that aboliſhed idolatrie; of godly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, that woulde not admit hereſies in their ſtates, of her noble father, that ouerthrew the popes vſurped tyrannie in this land, &amp; her owne former noble actions, then others. Of the French kings act wée diſpute not. Onely wée deſire God to open his eies, that hée may ſée how he ſtandeth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly hée telleth vs of the qualities of <hi>Clement</hi> the eight, and the king of Spaine, &amp; reporteth him to be <hi>A meeke, milde, ſweete, and holy man,</hi> and calleth king <hi>Philip Salomon the peacible.</hi> And certes euill ſhoulde hée deſerue his hire, if he did not ſet out theſe his two old maſters with extrauagant
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:177777:142"/> praiſes. But as in the faireſt monuments and moſt glorious ſepulchres there is ofttimes nothing but rotten bones; ſo I thinke while men thinke in theſe two to finde treaſure, they ſhall finde nothing, but rotten bones, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Clement</hi> the eight is a ſeuere perſecutor of Chriſtians, and not very gentle to cacolykes, as appéereth by the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of <hi>Don Ceſare</hi> Duke of Ferrara, againſt whom hée thundred with fire and ſworde, and manie foule words. Outwardly hée pretendeth to bée a ſhéepe, but inwardly hée is a rauening woolfe; a ſaint in ſhewe, but indéede of a filthie and<note n="a" place="margin">When he was in Minoribus, he was knowne to be a great han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of bordels.</note> vncleane life. A biſhop in name, but indéed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. King <hi>Philip</hi> is now dead, and loth I am to rake into his aſhes further then I néedes muſt, eſpecially hauing ſaide much of him alreadie. But the name of <hi>Salomon</hi> no man can deſerue woorſe, then hée, being neither extraordinarily wiſe, nor very ſtudious of peace: of which two his beſt friendes do teſtifie the firſt, and the latter is prooued by his troubleſome reigne, that neuer was without warres either with French, Dutch, Italians, Portugals, or Engliſh. But were the firſt neuer ſo milde, yet his office is wicked, his doctrine heretical, his practiſes deteſtable; and were hée not ſo, yet what peace can bée honorable, that bringeth with it ſlauerie; or compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion firme with him, that kéepeth no faith nor promiſe? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can wée looke either for honorable or ſound dealing with the Spaniard, ſo long as hée dependeth on the pope. Hée may percaſe deſire fauour for his faction, but will yéelde no exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from inquiſitors to true Chriſtians. Hée will deſire to trade with vs; wée ſhall not I thinke trade into the Indies. Finally hée will not yéelde vs and our aſſociates either reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and equall conditions, or firme aſſurance. If hée pleaſe to doe it, and can do it, I knowe none, but is moſt deſirous of peace.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly hée ſaith, <hi>There is no cauſe of doubt of dutifull behauiour of Engliſh cacolykes at home and abroad.</hi> But his ſaying ſheweth, that he hath neither ſhame, nor honeſtie in auouching thinges ſo falſe. What? Is there no cauſe for vs to doubt, when wée ſée how they are linked to the greateſt enimies this kingdome hath, and take themſelues neither bounde by oath nor affection further, then the pope giueth them leaue? Do wée looke for more loialtie at their handes,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:177777:142"/> then wée haue already founde at the handes of their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors and conſorts? Do wée thinke that ſodainly theſe ſerpents will caſt off their ſkins, or looſe their ſtinges? Do we not ſée how vndutifully the papiſts haue behaued themſelues in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and how they haue reuolted from their liege ſoueraigne, and that theſe warres were ſtirred by prieſtes and Ieſuites? Haue we not heard what maſſacres they haue committed in France, and how they haue leagued and confederated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt their kinges? Do wee not knowe howe in England they haue rebelled againſt their Souereigne Ladie, and ſought to murder her, and empoiſon her, and betray her, and her countrey into the handes of Spaniards and forreine enimies? What impudencie then, or rather furie doth poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe this Noddy, that he ſhoulde ſay, that <hi>There is no feare of their dutifull behauiour?</hi> He anſwereth that <hi>Their firſt and higheſt deſire is, that her Maieſtie woulde returne to the ſea of Rome, and that by this act all difficulties and iealouſies woulde be ended and taken away.</hi> But hée may as well ſay, that by yéelding to the Spaniards all controuerſies woulde be ended. Certes as well may the one be done, as the other, and yet neither without manifeſt impietie againſt religion, without perpetuall diſhonour to our nation, and vtter deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the countrey. This is the woorſt that can happen to a nation ſhamed, ſpoiled, beaten, vanquiſhed; and yet with theſe execrable rinegates it is the firſt and higheſt point, that they deſire, as themſelues confeſſe, ſeeking nothing more, then our hurt, diſhonor and deſtruction. They ſtudie to ruinate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to bring her Maieſtie &amp; their countrey into ſlauerie. Nay, and when they haue their deſire, they are nothing née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. For they may not thinke that all Engliſh men are ſo baſe, that euer they will endure either the idolatrous maſſe, or the tyrannie of the pope, or the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand of ſtrangers. Neither can any true Engliſh endure to receiue conditions either from pope or Spaniard, much leſſe, that they ſhall haue power to diſpoſe of this crowne and gouernment. If then this be their deſire, we are come to a full ſtoppe. this as long as wée liue neither will, nor can with honor, or ſafetie, or conſcience be yéelded.</p>
                     <p>Their ſecond deſire is as their proctor telleth vs, <hi>That they may haue the ſame libertie for their conſciences in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:177777:143"/> that our brethren haue in France and Germany.</hi> But wee haue anſwered alreadie, that it were impious, diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, dangerous, and vnprofitable to grant any ſuch matter. Neither is the caſe of France and Germanie like to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. There religion was alwaies openly profeſſed, and that by grant of princes and conſent of the people. Héere poperie ſince her Maieſties gouernment was neuer permitted. But if our aduerſarie coulde aſſure vs, that our brethren in Spaine and Italy might without danger profeſſe the Goſpell, and that we might heare the king of Spaine and princes of Italy ſecure vs as much; then ſhoulde hée receiue an other anſwere. In the meane while both he and others muſt haue patience, if we bridle thoſe, that woulde runne a courſe to the hazard of this kingdome. Neither becauſe we ſtande againſt this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>Do we therefore crie fire, and ſword, &amp; blood againſt the papiſts, nor do we crie out Crucifige, crucifige,</hi> as this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Iewe, and fugitiue frier chargeth vs. For we vtterlie renounce all ſuch bloodie maſſacres, and fierie executions, as the papiſtes practiſe againſt our brethren; but onely we tie vp theſe popiſh woolues, that woulde deuoure Chriſtes flocke; and ſtoppe their furious rage againſt their countreymen. We may not ſuffer them to come with fire and ſworde to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and deſolation of their countrey. Wée know that in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> times they perſecuted Chriſt in his members, and made vs beare his croſſe: but we are not ſo ſimple to put ſworde and fire into their handes againe. Now if they will néedes rebell againſt lawes; they ſhall finde vs readie in the field to defend our religion, prince, and countrey; and not burne vs at a ſtake, as moſt cruelly they haue done diuers of our brethren. If the papiſtes yet will quietly liue amongſt vs, we neither meane to endanger their liues, nor take away their landes, goods, and liberties. If they beginne to ſtirre, whatſoeuer ſhall happen, they muſt impute it to their owne deſeruings.</p>
                     <p>He telleth vs further, <hi>That there hath beene bloud inough ſpent in this realme, and that aboue a hundred and thirty prieſts haue loſt their liues within theſe twentie yeeres for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, men of peace, learned, vertuous, well deſcended, and martyrs.</hi> But if he had named the men, it would eaſily haue appeared, that they were no martyrs of Chriſt, but traytorous
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:177777:143"/> agentes of the pope and Spaniard ſent hither out of Italy, Spaine and other countries by forreine enimies. It would likewiſe haue appeared, that moſt of them were ſimple and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant youthes, that for néede were driuen to ſéeke aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, blindly led, furiouſly bent, fautors &amp; rayſers of faction, and ſuch as no common wealth could endure. And yet too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of this ſort haue béene ſpared, to the great hazard of the country; I pray God, that they do not firſt feele the harme, that are cauſe of foſtering ſuch yoong woolues. The laſt lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer knowing their natures, kept them ſhort. And time I hope will make vs ſée hidden truth. It is knowne what <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard</hi> practiſed with <hi>Babington,</hi> and his confederates. <hi>Biſley</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>The greene prieſt,</hi> profeſſed, and ſet it downe vnder his hand, that it was lawfull to kill the Quéene, and that himſelfe would haue doone it, if he had could.</p>
                     <p>The reſt were all linked in intelligence with forreine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. He therefore that deſireth liberty for ſuch men, doth not onely profeſſe himſelfe an open enemy of his prince and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but alſo impudently deſireth that ſuch may come amongſt vs, as may ſow ſedition, bring in ſtrangers, and cut our throtes. If this be a reaſonable requeſt, let him be heard. If we be weary of our liues, then let vs entertaine this butcherly race. They haue ſkill to cut mens throtes artificiallie and cloſely. And finally if we be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to heare her Maieſtie cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged to be an extreme perſequutor, and her iudges and iuſtice calumniated, as if they had doone to death peacible qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et men; then let vs open our eares to ſuch impudent petitions, as this is. I thinke no honeſt man can reade it without indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and therefore few words ſerue to refute it.</p>
                     <p>After he hath tould vs his pleaſure of popiſh traytors, and called them martyrs, he ioyneth recuſantes with them, who no doubt he eſtéemeth as confeſſors. Such confeſſors, ſuch martyrs, as neuer Chriſtes church knew: all either dying for treaſons, or ſuffering for hereſies, and diſorders, and ſet on by Antichriſt. Of theſe recuſants he propheſieth, <hi>That they muſt winne in the end. That all ſhall be paid vs; that feare is an euill meanes to make things continue; that her Maieſty will not liue alwaies; that if exaſperated mindes come to wreake their wrathes, great extremities will enſue; that we haue many eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abrode.</hi> All which diſcourſe doth ſhew, that the recuſants,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:177777:144"/> whatſoeuer they pretend, do nothing elſe but grind their téeth, and whet their ſwordes to take reuenge vpon vs; that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire her Maieſties death, whome God long preſerue; that they meane to ioyne with ſtrangers, and to worke the deſtruction of their aduerſaries by all meanes whatſoeuer. Our wiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary doth plainely confeſſe it, and threaten it, and by that meanes would ſtrike a terror into vs. Which as it may make himſelfe, and his conſortes odious; ſo it may teach vs firſt, to ſerue God as béeing threatned with this danger; next to take a courſe to ſtrangle ſuch vipers blood, as ſéeke the deſtruction of their prince and country. As for the feares he obiecteth, they may rather ſtirre vs vp to watch, then to feare. For the onely way to be without feare, is to remooue the cauſes of feare. He that hath madde dogges muſt tye them ſure vp, if he will not feare their biting. He that will not feare théeues, muſt ride well armed. If we arme reſolutely, I ſée no cauſe, as I haue ſaid alredy, but that the Spaniardes ſhould rather feare vs, then we them. To yéelde to conditions vnequall with papiſts, were not, as this ſenceleſſe ſophiſter ſurmiſeth, a way to cleare vs of feare, but to redouble both feare, and danger. For it is an eaſie matter to thruſt him downe to the bottome of the ſtaires, that is content to go downe one ſteppe. But he that ſtandeth vpon equall termes, and yéeldeth not to any diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conditions, nor feareth to méete his enemy vpon the way, may with more probabilitie defend himſelfe againſt him.</p>
                     <p>He alledgeth alſo the examples of <hi>Auguſtus, Henry</hi> the fourth, <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeuenth, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelues to clemency toward their latter daies, and would perſwade her Maieſty <hi>To vſe the ſame clemency and ſweetneſſe to the exhilerating of all her people.</hi> But firſt the caſe is ſo vnlike, as nothing can be more. For thoſe princes contended not about religion, but matters of ſtate. Now mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſtate may be compounded by remitting of a mans right. But religion may not be abandoned, for that it is the cauſe of God. Her Maieſty ſhe did not poſſeſſe her kingdome by violence, as thoſe princes did. And therefore if papiſts were true and loyall men; they ſhould not ſéeke to depriue her of her right. She neuer offered violence to papiſtes, but onely ſought to liue in peace; and put to death none, but ſuch as rebelled and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:177777:144" rendition="simple:additions"/> practiſed againſt her, ſparing but too many of this ſort: thoſe princes vſed clemency towards their ſubiectes, that were not linked with forreine enemies, nor were factious, and puniſhed thoſe rigorouſly, that practiſed againſt their ſtates. How then, if the caſe were like, canne her Maieſty not defend her right againſt ſuch traytors? Shall ſhe yéeld her crowne to her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? And is this the ſwéeteneſſe that the papiſtes ſéeke? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly admit her Maieſty ſhould ſpare traytors and factious perſons, this I confeſſe to prieſts and Ieſuites would be a ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full day, but there cannot be a greater calamity, that can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to good ſubiects. Nay it would be a diſſolution of lawes, and confuſion of the kingdome.</p>
                     <p>Séeing that the former examples fitted not his purpoſe, he bringeth in the example of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, <hi>Who, as Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner ſaid, was deſirous in his latter daies to returne to the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Romiſh church:</hi> Likewiſe he is ſtill harping vpon the French kinges ſubmiſſion to the pope. But that king <hi>Henry</hi> did euer purpoſe ſuch a matter, or that ſuch a magnanimous prince could endure to debaſe himſelfe ſo low, as to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a paltry frier, or a proude pope, is incredible. Nay the laſt negotiation with the French kings ambaſſadour, the king then lying at Hampton court, was to draw him likewiſe from the popes obedience. As for <hi>Gardiner</hi> he was neither ſo néere, nor ſo déere to the king, as to know any ſuch ſecret purpoſe, béeing long before the kings ſickneſſe, forbidden to come at the king: and his practiſe about the pope had coſt him his life, if hée had not ſubmitted himſelfe to the kings mercie.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it certaine whether <hi>Gardiner</hi> euer vttred any ſuch matter or not. If hée did, yet we are not bound to beléeue him. Nay wée are to beléeue that hée ſpoke ſo much rather to pleaſe the popes legat, then of any truth.</p>
                     <p>But if her Maieſtie do conſider, how her noble father was diſhonored by this generation, ſhée cannot chooſe but deteſt them, and follow his ſteps, that aboliſhed this tyrannie; and not of thoſe, that eſtabliſh it. Further if examples may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile; then is ſhée rather to follow the ſteps of godly Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, that ſtopped the mouthes of heretikes, and woulde not ſuffer them to practiſe their falſe religion, and of the godly kings of Iudah, that aboliſhed all monuments of idolatrie, and burnt the idolatrous prieſtes bones vpon their altars,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:177777:145"/> then of idolaters. As for the French king, that for a crowne altered his religion, wée haue little to ſay. We will rather praie for him, then diſpute of his dooings. Her Maieſties caſe is farre vnlike his, being with content of all quiet and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſubiects poſſeſſed of her crowne, and able by Gods aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to defend it, and all her rightes, maugre all enimies, and traitors, that iointly conſpire againſt her.</p>
                     <p>Hée <hi>appealeth to your Lordſhips conſiderations, what a comfort it would be to her Maieſtie, and your ſelues, to ſee all ſortes of people laugh, and ſing togither, and praie to God moſt hartily for her Maieſties health, wealth, and proſperous long continuance.</hi> All which I do beléeue, her Maieſtie bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo gracious a prince, and your ſelues being ſo ſtudious of the good of your countrey, and her Maieſties ſafetie. But they that deſir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>is, muſt take a farre contrarie courſe to this, which our aduerſary deſireth. Her Maieſty muſt, as ſhe doth, reſolutely defend Gods religion: iuſtice muſt be executed ſeuerely: wicked members muſt be rooted out vtterly: good men muſt be cheriſhed louingly, and employed reſpectiuely. But if we ſhould once admitte a packe of factious traytors, within the bowels of this kingdome, and harken to <hi>Parſons</hi> that traytorous and infamous Ieſuite; all our ſinging would be turned into mourning, and our laughing, into lamenting, as it is in Ireland. The prayers as well, as the practiſes of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes would be little for her Maieſties ſafety, or continuance; as former experience teacheth vs. all this ioyfull ſtate which theſe traytors dreame of, would be nothing, but a ſtate deuided by warres and ſedition, a time of darkeneſſe and deſolation, and extreme miſery. finally he bluſheth not to propoſe vnt vs the example of ſuch, as firſt profeſſed true religion after the firſt eſtabliſhment of reformation, that deſired, that their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence might not bée forced: which doth quite ouerthrow his cauſe. For as in Italy and Spaine, and ſuch places, as were ſubiect to popiſh princes our brethren coulde obtaine no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration for the exerciſe of true religion; ſo they cannot with any reaſon deſire the eſtabliſhment of their maſſe, where vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſtian princes it is vtterly aboliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore if nothing be more impious, then to erect ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and to ſuffer notorious ſuperſtition and hereſie to be preached; if nothing be more dangerous and diſſolute, then to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:177777:145"/> receiue rebels, traytors, and enemies within the entrals of our country; if no compoſition can be made with the pope of Rome &amp; the whoore of Babylon; if nothing be more diſhonorable, then to liſten to enemies and traytors threatnings, and promiſes; I doubt not, but all men of religion and iudgement, and well affected to their country, ſée that our aduerſaries motion is impious, dangerous, diſhonorable, and not to bée yéelded vnto, nor granted without the deſtruction of the preſent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and deſolation of this kingdome. All which I referre to your Lordſhips conſideration, and beſéech God to reueale the truth to the ignorant, and to eſtabliſh the weake, and to confound all that are enimes either to his truth, or to their moſt gracious Prince and déere countrey.</p>

                     <p>After this diuers friers and prieſts, taking vpon them to plead the popes cauſe, haue determined vnwritten traditions and cuſtomes of the church, and the popes determinations and decretalles, to be the foundations, and principles of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh faith.<note n="b" place="margin">Loc.

For in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time the councell iudged the pope, as appéereth by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers councels of Rome, and by the late councell of <hi>Piſa,</hi>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:177777:176"/> where <hi>Alexander</hi> the fift was choſen pope, and by the councell of Conſtance, where thrée popes were depoſed; and by the councell of Baſilea, that depoſed <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth.</p>
                     <p n="59">59. Of late time the pope hath taken on him power to make lawes to binde the whole church, and to place and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place biſhops and prelats at his pleaſure. Lately alſo hath hée begun to beare himſelfe as ſupreme doctor and iudge in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion, in hearing of appeales out of all prouinces, and in excommunicating of princes and emperors, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the worlde.</p>
                     <p n="60">60. Vntill <hi>Boniface</hi> the 9. his time he was not Lord of Rome, nor did hée beare himſelfe, as a temporall prince, for that is teſtified by <hi>Theodorie</hi> of Niem, and diuers other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of hiſtories.</p>
                     <p n="61">61. <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſeuenth was the firſt, that tooke on him to depoſe emperors, as appeareth by his dictates, and by his bloody warres. Before his time it was a rare matter, to ſée a pope intermeddle with warres or gouernement of kingdoms. After the time of <hi>Gregory,</hi> theſe, that pretend to be <hi>Peters</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, prooued the onely firebrandes of all the warres and troubles in chriſtendome.</p>
                     <p n="62">62. Before <hi>Innocent</hi> the third his time it was neuer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged a matter capital, to thinke otherwiſe of religion, or the ſacraments of the church, then the pope of Rome beléeued and taught. He firſt perſequuted Chriſtians with all extremities: and now it is the popes common practiſe, to kill all religious Chriſtians, that ſhall contradict his vſurpations.</p>
                     <p n="63">63. In ancient time the popes were confirmed by empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and neuer durſt pretend a right to depoſe princes. Now they deny any to be emperor, but ſuch, as is ſacred by the pope; and do take to themſelues power to depoſe princes, and to cauſe ſubiectes to rebell againſt them.</p>
                     <p n="64">64. The firſt Chriſtians, albeit not tyed to emperors by oath, yet neuer rebelled againſt wicked emperors. But now the pope cauſeth Chriſtians to breake their othes, and they are made to beléeue, that it is meritorious to rebell againſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces excommunicate by the pope, and to murder them. Neither may we thinke, it was want of meanes, that made them to be obedient. For<note n="a" place="margin">Ad Scapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam.</note>

                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:177777:176"/>65. The firſt Chriſtians ſerued God in ſpirite and truth, and were knowne by their modeſtie and vertue. But the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of papiſts conſiſteth all in eating red herrings and fiſh, in faſting, knocking, knéeling, greaſing, ſhauing, croſſing, ringing, and outward ceremonies. At Rome, and in Spaine, &amp; Italy, are common bordels, and bankes of vſurie, and ſuch diſſolution, that the very heathens might not compare with them. Swearing, whooring, killing, are ſmall faultes among them, ſo they meddle not with the popes authoritie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                     <p>Finally, for that it is not poſſible to rehearſe all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, I ſay, and by Gods grace ſhall prooue, that the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of papiſts which wée reiect, is nothing but a packe of nouelties, and hereſies, and the corruption of true catholike and Chriſtian religion. Wherefore as in this chapter we haue noted their nouelties, ſo in the chapter enſuing wée purpoſe to make good our challenge concerning their hereſies; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed, I hope it will largely appéere, that they are no catholikes.</p>

                     <p n="39">39 As the true Church is figured by Ieruſalem, which was the holy citie of God; ſo the malignant church is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied partly by Babylon, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 18. and partly by the purple whore, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 17. that had a cup of gold in her hand full of abomination and filthineſſe. If then the ſtate of Rome vnder the popes be repreſented by this purple harlot, then muſt it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow, that the Church of Rome is not the citie of God, but rather the city of Babylon, and ſynagogue of Satan adhering to antichriſt. But that the ſtate of new Rome, as it is ſubiect to the pope, and is the fountaine and metropolitane church of all idolatrie, and hereſie, is meant by the purple whore, and by Babylon, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. diuers arguments do teach vs. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the order of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> hiſtorie doth ſhew it. For after that in the 12. chapter, and in the beginning of the thirtéenth he had deſcribed the ſtate of olde Rome vnder the emperors, and the decay of that empire; it is not likely that he ſhould returne againe to deſcribe the flouriſhing ſtate of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:177777:203"/> empire in the ſeuentéenth chapter, and ſo to relate the ſame things confuſedly.

But they did not loue nor honour the Roman empire, nor receiued any idolatrous worſhip from Rome. But from the pope they haue, and with this purple whore they haue committed fornication. <hi>Seuenthly,</hi> the kings of the earth lamented not the deſtruction of the Romane em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, but rather reioyced at it, deuiding the ſame among themſelues.

For to ſay, that the church of Rome began at Hieruſalem, is as abſurd, as to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:177777:205"/> ſay, that Rome is Hieruſalem, or to affirm that Rome now is like to old Rome. Our aduerſarie ſhould do vs great fauour to ſhew that the glorie and fulneſſe of power that the pope chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth, together with his cardinals, dumbe biſhops, maſſe-prieſts, idle monks, lying fryars and all the popes decretals and ceremonies are come from Hieruſalem.

The rocke of ſucceſſion, vpon which they build ſo huge concluſions, we haue ſhewed to be nothing, but a banke of ſand. We haue ſhewed alſo, that their doctrine is not only diuers, but contrarie to the doctrine of Chriſt the head of the Church, and of his apoſtles. And how great contentions haue béene in the Romiſh church, not onely the ſchiſmes, and warres betwixt popes and princes, but alſo the differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout all points of religion, which is apparant both in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes of ſchoolmen, and alſo in the writings of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and his conſorts, do declare. That the Romaniſts haue corrupted the faith, not onely with nouelties, but alſo with diuers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and haue changed both the ancient forme of apoſtolike gouernement, and alſo the principles and grounds of faith eſtabliſhed both by Fathers and councels, and by the apoſtles themſelues, and haue yéelded to hereſies, and béene ouercome of the gates of hell, I thinke, no man can doubt, that readeth this diſcourſe, and compareth the late procéedings of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh church, to the rule deliuered vnto vs by Chriſt Ieſus.</p>

For he commendeth that for the true church, <hi>that is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike and apoſtolike, and which abhorreth all nouelties and hereſies, and idolatrie, and whoſe doctrine is confirmed by ſcriptures, moſt certaine traditions, councels, fathers, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the ancient church, and which teacheth the narrow way and maketh ſubiects obedient, and hath infallible iudges, and is ſure to continue.</hi> But the Romiſh church is neither catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like nor apoſtolike, neither doth it abhorre either hereſie or idolatrie, nor ſhun profane nouelties. The doctrine of that church hath neither ground of ſcripture, ancient councels, nor fathers; neither can the Romiſh doctors bring any certaine
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:177777:206"/> proofe of their traditions. It teacheth a broad way, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth rebellious ſubiects. In iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it hath no other certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then the popes determination. Finally, already that tower of Babel, which is built ſo high, doth begin to totter, and as we truſt, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not long ſtand. Further he ſaith, <hi>that euerie church that is riſen after the firſt planting of religion, and gone out of the catholike church, and from the apoſtolike doctrine, and is not the communion of ſaintes, nor euer viſible; and laſtly, that is not the teacher of all diuine truth, and the vndoubted mother of Chriſts children, is not the true church of Chriſt.</hi> But the Church of Rome, as it is now viſible in the pope and cardinals, and officers of the popes chamber, in popiſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, ſacrificing prieſts, monkes, friers and nunnes, and their officers and adherents roſe out of the earth long after the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times, and went out of the catholike &amp; apoſtolike church, and hath for the popes quarrell oppoſed it ſelfe againſt Chriſt and his true doctrine. The ſame is alſo departed from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient faith, and is no more to bée tearmed Chriſts Church, which is a communion of ſaints, linked together in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſts true faith, but rather the combination of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and the ſynagogue of Satan. Such a church as is now to be ſéene at Rome, and in the prouinces adhering to it, was not viſible many ages after Chriſt, neither was any ſuch church for a long time extant in the world: neither when the ſame began to ſhew her ſelfe in great ruffe, did ſhe either teach all truth, or refuſe all hereſie &amp; falſe doctrine, or beare or bring forth children to Chriſt, but to antichriſt. And therfore we may ſafely conclude, that the Romiſh church of theſe times is the ſynagogue of Satan, and not the true church of Chriſt Ieſus. The nature and propertie of the true and vnſpotted ſpouſe of Chriſt, the inſeparable qualities of true faith, and ſuch as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſe the ſame, and finally the confeſſion and doctrine of the aduerſaries themſelues, when they ſpeake of the true church, and true faith, and true profeſſours, and matters inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vnto them in generall, do declare it to be ſo.</p>

All true Engliſh men are to oppoſe themſelues againſt ſuch, as ſéeke to bring in ſtrangers, to ſet a fire in the midſt of their countrey, to deſtroy their wiues, children, friendes, country-men and moſt déere coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>

                     <p>Nay the papiſts, that haue any thing, albeit they deſire an alteration of religion, yet haue no reaſon to worke their feates by violence. They may ſée by Ireland, that warres

                        <hi>Xenophon, is treaſon, by how much it is more difficult to take heed of traitors, then ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. With our enemies we may be reconciled, but traitors are neuer to be truſted.</hi> Nay, by lawes and all lawfull means they are to be diſcouered, puniſhed and auoyded, ſéeing they ſéeke to bring this land into ſubiection of the pope and Spaniard, to ouerthrow the lawes, to deſtroy her Maieſtie, and her people, and to make this land a ſpectacle to all the world of extreme miſeries.</p>
                     <p>Neither do I thinke that the papiſts will denie this to be true, or that <hi>Parſons</hi> the common proctour for traitors dare auouch the contrarie. Nay cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> in his Treatiſe againſt the iuſtice of England, in executing of certaine prieſts &amp; their conſorts, doth diſſemble his clients treaſons, &amp; colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth their practiſes, as much as he can. And N.D. ſticketh not to auow, that papiſts are good ſubiects. And I doubt not but all papiſts will denie themſelues to be either idolaters or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, or enemies to her Maieſtie, or their countrie; or that they haue committed treaſon, or tranſgreſſed any ancient law made againſt treaſon. I know alſo, that they will plead, that they haue not attempted againſt her Maieſties life or the ſtate, or ſought to ſtirre rebellion, or bring in ſtrangers, or to do any thing, but that which belongeth to a good conſcience, either in prieſtly function, or otherwiſe. In ſum, they ſticke not to affirme, that they are apoſtolicall men, and ſeeke onely by
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:177777:214"/> teaching and ſaying of maſſes to win mens ſoules, and not to meddel with ſtate matters.</p>
                     <p>Let vs therefore particularly conſider, whether all that hath béene ſpoken in generall, may not properly be charged vpon the popes agents and adherents, that either haue béene executed as traitors, or els wander vp and downe diſguiſed, as falſe teachers. I ſay it may, and that therfore they are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe crimes, that I haue named, and haue diuerſly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed all thoſe lawes, which haue béene mentioned, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to be reputed as wicked enemies of religion, and diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all traytors to their prince and countrie. That they are idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it is too too apparant. For idolatrie is nothing, but <hi>falſe worſhip, that attributeth that which is due to God, to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> as<note n="a" place="margin">2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 93.</note> 
                        <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> and other ſchoolemen confeſſe. And it cannot be denied to be true. For ſéeing idolatrie is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to Gods true worſhip; that worſhip muſt néeds be idolatry, that aſcribeth Gods honour to creatures, contrarie to the firſt &amp; ſecond commandement. But all papiſts giue the worſhip of God to creatures, turning their prayers and ſpirituall ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to our Lady, to angels, ſaints and mortall creatures. They haue alſo maſſes made not only in honour of angels, but in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Dominicke, Francis,</hi> and other pety ſaints of late ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. They burne incenſe, kiſſe and fall downe before ſaints &amp; idols. They giue that which they call <hi>Latriam,</hi> and which is confeſſed of all hands, to be a kind of worſhip due to God only, to the croſſe, and to the images of Chriſt, and of the Trinitie. <hi>Cùm Chriſtus,</hi> ſaith<note n="b" place="margin">

It may be proued alſo by the proprietie of the word <hi>Idolum,</hi> that is nothing els but <hi>parua imago,</hi> or a diminutiue of <gap reason="foreign">

And ſo the Gréeke Church ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them, which albeit it reteineth painted images, yet it condemneth the worſhip of grauen images, or <hi>ſculptilia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, that popiſh prieſts and friers are falſe prophets,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:177777:215"/> falſe teachers and damnable heretiks, I haue demonſtrated by authority of the ancient Church, that condemned long ſince diuers of their doctrines for hereſies.<note n="a" place="margin">Suprà c. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> It is proued alſo by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers nouelties, which they hold contrarie to the form of words and doctrine deliuered by Chriſts apoſtles, of which I haue brought diuers particulars in the ſecond chapter of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. It appeareth alſo by <hi>Bellarmines,</hi> and his fellowes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations; wherein they teach diuers pointes contrarie to ſcriptures, and not long ſince heard of in the catholike church, as is iuſtified by the writings of our teachers againſt them. the ſame may alſo be verified by their counterfeit traditions and lying legends, of which the firſt they make equall to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the ſecond they beléeue as deliuered by the Romiſh church. Yet are their traditions moſt falſe, &amp; their legends moſt fabulous. If frier <hi>Parſons</hi> will maintaine the contrary, let him prooue to vs the ceremonies and parts of the maſſe to haue come from Chriſt Ieſus: that the legends of <hi>Dominike</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> are true; <hi>That</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Legenda de Catharina di Siena Italic.</note> 
                        <hi>Catharine of Siena had her face transformed like to Chriſtes face, and that ſhe was lifted vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the aire, and maried to Chriſt:</hi> that Saint <hi>Francis</hi> was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe made conformable to Chriſt, and had his fiue woundes printed in his bodie; and that all thoſe miracles reported in the legendes are true. Likewiſe hée muſt prooue, that all the ſhameleſſe writings, which the popes and their agents haue publiſhed of late time are true: or elſe all the world will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them for falſe teachers, and wicked heretikes.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly their whole courſe of life, and all their actions haue ſufficiently declared them to be a faction oppoſite both to true religion now profeſſed in England, and alſo to her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and the eſtate. And that they are oppoſite to our religion, themſelues profeſſe, albeit they deny it true: which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in diuers treatiſes wée haue iuſtified, and ſhall alwaies bée ready to iuſtifie the ſame both in publike diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and writing, as oft as occaſion ſhall ſerue. The reſt wée ſhall now declare. I haue héeretofore brought proofes, that the papiſts oppoſed themſelues to her Maieſtie both ſince, and before her entrance into the kingdome. This moreouer you ſhall vnderſtand of <hi>Sanders,</hi> or <hi>Riſhton,</hi> or both, men hired to ſpeake villany of their prince &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try. <hi>Saepe conata eſt Maria,</hi> ſay<note n="c" place="margin">Sanders de ſchiſm. lib. <hi>3.</hi>

And when it pleaſed God to fruſtrate their purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and intentions; yet woulde they not yeelde her any hartie obedience. The popiſh prelates refuſed to conſecrate her, and hardly coulde one bée got amongſt many, to accompliſh that ceremonie. but rather they incited the French king <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond to proclaime <hi>Marie</hi> Quéene of Scots Quéene.

That this trouble was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by papiſts, it is no queſtion. They alſo<note n="c" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> determined to excommunicate the Quéene, and when that ſéemed daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, they complained to the pope, and ſtirred vp forreine princes againſt the Quéene and ſtate: all which bée pointes of high treaſon, for which if they had béene called in queſtion, law woulde haue adiudged them traytors. That they were not ſo cléere as is pretended, it appéereth, for that their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence accuſing them, ſome fledde beyond the ſeas, others began to plot a rebellion, which afterwarde broke out anno <hi>1569.</hi> And to make the ſide the ſtronger, <hi>Thomas Harding</hi> about the yéere <hi>1567,</hi> was ſent with faculties into England, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the people to the pope, and to draw them from the prince. Not long after pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fift at the ſolicitation of diuers of them publiſhed his excommunication againſt her Maieſtie, depriuing her of her kingdome, aſſoiling her ſubiectes from their obedience, and by the meanes of <hi>Nicholas Morton</hi> a fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious prieſt cauſing the earles of Northumberland and Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merland, and diuers other papiſts to take armes againſt her. Being ouerthrowne in that rebellion, and conſidering, that all was for want of number and force, they erect one Seminarie at Doway ann. <hi>1569.</hi> and another at Rome ann. <hi>1579.</hi> which by the yéere <hi>1584.</hi> did<note n="f" place="margin">Sanders de ſchiſm. lib. <hi>3.</hi>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:177777:216"/> anno <hi>1579.</hi> they ſent <hi>Sanders</hi> and diuers prieſtes into Ireland, where finding the people readie, they preſently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed a rebellion, the which though ſuppreſſed for a time, yet by the perſwaſions of <hi>Archer</hi> and other Ieſuites, and <hi>Owen Mac Teag</hi> and other ſeditious prieſts, hath ſince flamed very bright, &amp; brought all that countrey into trouble &amp; combuſtion. Anno <hi>1580. Parſons</hi> and <hi>Campian</hi> and their conſorts came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England with large authoritie to make way for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the popes bull. Of which company <hi>Campian</hi> refuſed directly to acknowledge her Maieſtie to bée his lawfull Quéene, and woulde not diſallow the trecherous writings of <hi>Sanders</hi> and <hi>Briſtow,</hi> as appéereth vnder his owne hande wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. The reſt applied their buſineſſe in working diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the common ſort, and ſetting on <hi>Somerfield, Parry,</hi> and diuers others to kill the Quéene. <hi>Ballard</hi> a ſeditious prieſt was ſet on to drawe <hi>Babington, Tichborne</hi> and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts to attempt that, which other coulde not performe. And that hath béene the continuall labour of <hi>Parſons, Holt, Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, Walpoole, Worthington, Gifford</hi> and other Iebuſites and prieſts. Anno <hi>1588.</hi> they brought vpon their countrey the Spaniſh nauy. Neither haue they ceaſed at any time ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to attempt againſt her Maieſties life, or by rebellion or warres to oppugne the ſtate. But it cannot bée denied, but ſuch attempts by all lawes are treaſon.</p>
                     <p>And if they ſay they were neither priuy nor conſenting vnto them, they declare themſelues to bée verie ſhameleſſe. For it is notorious to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world that <hi>Nicholas Morton, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi> and <hi>Plumtree,</hi> and diuers other prieſtes were actors in the Northren rebellion. So likewiſe <hi>Sanders</hi> &amp; diuers other prieſts were actors in the Iriſh rebellions. Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> &amp; diuers Engliſh prieſts came in perſon with the Spaniſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces intended againſt their countrey. <hi>Parſons</hi> and diuers other his conſorts were alſo ready to come with the Spaniſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces anno <hi>1588.</hi> and to looſe no time, while matters were in preparing, he holpe to make and print a trecherous and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable libell againſt the Quéene and ſtate. <hi>Ballard</hi> was the principall in <hi>Babingtons</hi> conſpiracie. Againe, thoſe that were not actors either in the execution of the popes bull, or in the rebellions and conſpiracies dreſſed by their conſorts in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Ireland, did notwithſtanding allow them. None of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:177777:216"/> them dare open their mouthes once to miſlike pope <hi>Pius</hi> his bull, that vtterly diſableth her Maieſtie, and depriueth her of her crowne. They all do well like of <hi>Morton, Sanders, Allen, Briſtow,</hi> and ſuch like trumpets of ſedition, and allowe their writings, and that, to go no further, appéereth by the ſeditious Ward-word. Nay albeit diuers of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might haue had fauor, if they woulde haue condemned them, and their writings; yet coulde they not be induced thereunto: as appéereth by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres of <hi>Campian, Sherwin, Briant, Kirby, Filby</hi> and diuers other prieſtes.

                     <p>Further, the Ieſuites are all linked in affection to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, and for that, among other cauſes, were expulſed out of France.

Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that all our deſeins and purpoſes are deſcried to our enemies, and nothing paſſeth in court, or country, but they giue preſent notice thereof vnto them.</p>

The firſt is prooued by experience. For that their conſortes began to attempt in England, and haue in part effected in Ireland: and for this purpoſe haue they erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Seminaries, and ſent into England &amp; Ireland whole troupes of prieſtes, and deale both with forreine princes and domeſticall malcontents. Neither may wee doubt, but that al theſe ſeditious fellows come with one purpoſe and reſolution, not daring to attempt any thing beyond their commiſſion. Secondly the facultie graunted to <hi>Parſons</hi> and <hi>Campian</hi> doth plainly ſhew, that when the Bull can bée executed, then all the Romaniſtes are bounde to do it. Thirdly the popes wordes are plaine. Hee<note n="l" place="margin">Bulla Pij <hi>5.</hi> &amp; Sixti <hi>5.</hi>
                        </note> commandeth all his adherents <hi>To execute his ſentence vnder paine of excommunication.</hi> Fourthly the doctrine of Ieſuites doth plainly allow the popes power to depoſe princes; and all that faction holdeth that his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences are to bée obeied vnder paine of excommunication.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly neither woulde the pope nor Spaniard beſtowe ſuch charge in maintaining theſe fugitiues, but that they hope, againe to bée requited. Finally the ſame appéereth by their owne confeſſions, actions, and procéedings. <hi>Campian</hi> and his conſorts béeing demanded, <hi>Whether they tooke the Queene to be lawfull Queene, notwithſtanding the popes ſentence of excommunication,</hi> and <hi>per</hi> conſequent, whether <hi>Sanders</hi> and <hi>Briſtow</hi> and ſuch as teach otherwiſe, taught ſoundly; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to anſwere directly, and woulde neither acknowledge her to bée their lawfull Quéene, the popes ſentence being in force, nor condemne that traitorous doctrine.

Aſſuredly if all do not ſpeake ſo groſſely, yet all theſe concluſions flowe of the popes doctrine in this caſe of depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of princes. In the foreſaide reſolutions it is flatly reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that it is lawfull to kill the Quéene: but ſay the prieſtes, <hi>Rebus vt nunc conſtitutis multo ſatius eſſet ne loqui quidem ea de re.</hi>

                     <p>The ſecond is prooued by their earneſt ſolicitations from time to time to bring in the Spaniard: and themſelues I thinke will not denie, but that they ſéeke, that the pope may haue ſoueraigne gouernment, in all eccleſiaſticall cauſes at the leaſt. The erection of the Engliſh Seminaries in Spaine, and other places was made for no other ende. Neither hath <hi>Parſons</hi> and the Ieſuites buſied themſelues of long time about any other purpoſe more, then to preferre the Spaniſh title. His commendation alſo of Spaniardes and his mediation for peace with them in his former treatiſe, doth flowe from no other cauſe. This is the cauſe alſo why the Seminary men that come out of Spaine into England do diſtribute certaine graines and tokens of faction, as a certaine<note n="g" place="margin">In his allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against Ieſuites.</note> prieſt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them.</p>
                     <p>Now then if wée will but conſider the premiſſes, which not onely by hiſtories, experience, and our owne knowledge,

                     <p>Neither can any excuſe himſelfe and ſay, <hi>That it is no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to bring in graines, or medals, or to bee a prieſt made by the popes faction, or to reconcile men to the church,</hi> and to commit ſuch like matters, as later lawes haue made treaſon. For albeit theſe thinges, howſoeuer they are to bée cenſured, ſimply of themſelues are not treaſon: yet if graines and beads, and ſuch like toyes bée notes of a faction oppoſite to the ſtate; then is it treaſon by all lawes to haue them, that condemne notes of faction. That they are notes of faction it is apparant by thoſe, that are brought out of Spaine to diſtribute to ſuch as like the <hi>Infantaes</hi> title.

                     <p>Againe to be a prieſt or falſe prophet, ſimply in it ſelfe; is not treaſon: but by prieſthood to vnite himſelfe to a publike enimie, and to make himſelfe thereby of a faction againſt the ſtate, is and alwaies was to bée condemned as treaſon.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly to bée reconciled to the church, is no treaſon; but to be reconciled to the pope, &amp; to take his ſide, that by armes and practiſes ſeeketh to ouerthrow the ſtate, cannot be eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med otherwiſe then as treaſon: as may alſo appéere by the arreſt giuen by the Court of Parliament of Paris a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Ieſuites. For albeit the ſame miſliked not the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſimplie; yet becauſe it was iudged a faction oppoſite againſt the prince and ſtate, the whole order of Ieſuites was expulſed out of France.</p>
                     <p>Some alſo may pretend, that it is a point of religion to obey the pope: which notwithſtanding is a matter vtterly falſe. For in ancient time neither did Biſhops attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Princes, nor did Chriſtians beleeue they had any ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. Nay, as <hi>Sigebertus Gemblacenſis</hi> teſtifieth, it was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den flat hereſie, which now the Ieſuites hold and teach as a point of their religion. But were it religion to obey the pope;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:177777:222"/> yet can it not be religion to rebell againſt Princes, to depoſe them, to murther them, to adhere to forrein enimies, that ſéeke the trouble of the ſtate, as doth the popiſh faction. For<note n="p" place="margin">Breuiar. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratij.</note> 
                        <hi>Sylue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> a pope of Rome was condemned himſelfe for packing with the <hi>Gothes</hi> againſt the Emperor: and <hi>Abiathar</hi> and his conſorts, that<note n="q" place="margin">3. <hi>Reg. c.</hi> 1.</note> would haue made <hi>Adoniah</hi> king contrarie to <hi>Dauids</hi> intention, were therefore<note n="r" place="margin">3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 2.</note> puniſhed, and hee depoſed from his prieſthood. Finally, to ſay <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> and to make croſſes, is not ſimply euill: but to ſay <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> to worke a coniuration, or to make a croſſe to that purpoſe, is an act of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition. So to obey a good Biſhop in it ſelfe, is not euill; but to do it to worke ſedition or rebellion, is treaſon: much more to obey wicked popes, to wicked purpoſes. All thoſe therefore that adhere to this faction, let them beware their actions come not to examination, leaſt they engage themſelues too far, and be found guiltie of high treaſon, ſeeing the prieſts and others, that worke in the popes buſineſſe, by many lawes are declared to be plaine traytors.</p>
                     <p>Martyres certes they cannot be eſtéemed, vnleſſe treaſon be religion; and falſhood truth, and Antichriſt be to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for Chriſt Ieſus. For the Church of God holdeth them for Martyres, that died for the profeſſion and teſtimonie of Chriſt Ieſus. But ſuch of the popiſh faction, as haue béene exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in England, died for mayntenance of the popes faction, and his tyrannie, taking on him to take away the crowne from lawfull Princes, and ſéeking by armes and treaſon to murther them, and all loyally affected to them. And this is moſt apparantly approued by the enditements framed againſt them, by the depoſitions of witneſſes, and the whole forme of their triall, iudgement and execution. As for points of faith, they were not once mentioned in all the proceſſe made againſt them; neither was euer any papiſt among vs troubled for his leude opinion concerning the maſſe, or any other point of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ſuperſtition.</p>

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:177777:224"/> of deſperate cutthrotes, like the Iebuſites, that deſperately would aduenture to diſpatch whomſoeuer their Generall would command them to murther, died oftentimes moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly: and this they accounted a ſpeciall point of religion. Yet in truth no man can eſtéeme them martyrs. Why then ſhould the rebels, traitors and Aſſaſſins, which haue béene employed in the Popes buſineſſe, and for his cauſe haue béene drawne into treaſon, be accounted martyrs? If becauſe they are put in the popes kalendar: it may be anſwered, that it is Chriſt and not the pope; the cauſe of religion, and not of faction, that maketh martyrs.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it materiall, that grace hath béene offered to ſome that haue béene executed for treaſon, if they would haue renounced the pope and his treacherous doctrine and faction.

Nor may the aduerſaries thinke, that theſe fellowes were therefore onely puniſhed for religion: but rather that they were obſtinate traitors, that like the Aſſaſſins, made it a point of religion vpon the popes warrant, to take armes, and to practiſe againſt lawfull Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats, and to murther them, which indéede is treaſon.

In time paſt men did not imagine that <hi>Allen, Parſons, Campian, Holt, Englefield,</hi> and other Iebuſites and prieſtes, and their conſorts and adherents had any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, then to plant their popiſh and cacolike religion. This<note n="a" place="margin">Ad perſequut. Anglos.</note> 
                        <hi>Allen</hi> told vs in a long diſcourſe to that purpoſe. This <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> and the prieſtes, that came from Rome proteſted. And this is the ground of all their declarations, ſupplications and petitions made for moderation in executing the lawes againſt prieſtes and recuſants. And ſo credulous &amp; ſimple were ſome of vs poore ſoules, that we beléeued their faire words and gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:177777:228"/> and determined to ſhew them all poſſible fauour. But now we ſée they ſéeke the deſtruction of her Maieſty, the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of ſtrangers, the trouble of the kingdome by rebellion, and the vtter deſolation of their natiue countrey: as we haue prooued by many particulars. <hi>Parſons</hi> in his Ward-word ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon him the defence of publike enimies and traytors, ſéeking by all meanes to diſgrace his owne nation, and this ſtate. Being acquainted with <hi>Parries</hi> intention for the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thring of her Maieſtie, he reuealed it not, nay he diſſuaded one that went about to reueale it, as he confeſſeth in a letter of his, which will be prooued, and I hope ſhewed, if he will denie it. By him and his conſorts <hi>Holt, Worthington, Gifford, Allen, Walpoole,</hi> and others, diuers other aſſaſſinors haue béene perſuaded, hired and ſuborned to kil or empoyſon the Quéene, as wil be proued, not only by the confeſſions of the parties, that were employed, but alſo by the depoſitions and writings of certaine popiſh prieſts, that charge the Ieſuiticall faction with this intended aſſaſſinat.</p>
                     <p>It is playne that they haue by all meanes ſought to ſtirre vp rebellion at home, and to bring vpon vs forrein enimies from abroad. The rebellions in England and Ireland, the practiſes of D. <hi>Storie, Throkmorton, Charles Paget, Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and <hi>Ballard,</hi> and diuers doe prooue the firſt. The ſecond is prooued by the teſtimonie of <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> and <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> by <hi>Cardinall Allens,</hi> and <hi>Parſons</hi> negotiation with the king of Spaine, the pope, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> and diuers others, teſtified in their owne actions, &amp; writings, and to be prooued by infinit letters and writings of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts: which as occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal ſerue, ſhal be produced againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; in part hath béene alreadie touched in the former diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>And I do not thinke, that any prieſt will either directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the popes hoſtile actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s againſt vs, or acknowledge the Quéenes right to her kingdome, notwithſtanding the popes declaratorie ſentence, or any thing hée can doe againſt her.</p>
                     <p>Moſt apparant it is therefore that they ſeeke the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and deſolation of this ſtate, and are all combined with thoſe that profeſſe themſelues our enimies. <hi>Anno</hi> 1571. there was a plot layde by them to bring in the Duke of Guiſe with the French to ſurpriſe London: and no doubt but they haue layde many other plots, which are not come to our notice.</p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:177777:228"/>
                     <p>Neither were they euer more buſie or in better hope then at this inſtant, albeit we take our ſelues for the moſt part to be in a ſtate moſt aſſured. For <hi>firſt</hi> they make no queſtion, but they ſhall bring with them all the force, that the pope &amp; Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard can make, who are alſo intereſſed in this cauſe in regard of their ſeuerall pretenſes. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the faction of the Ieſuites haue attempted to cauſe all their adherents in England to make ſeuerall aſſociations in euerie ſhire, and mooued them to chuſe a head in euerie diuiſion, as ſhall be prooued by their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Now what is this, but the beginning of a rebellion? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they haue gone about to fortifie themſelues by diuers pretended titles, which <hi>Parſons</hi> would haue preſently to be ſet on foote. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> euerie ſeuerall prieſt hath his ſeuerall flocke and charge. Let it then be eſtéemed what numbers 3. or 400. paſtorall charges may affoord. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> of late they haue made a Prouinciall of Ieſuites, called <hi>Walley, aliâs Garnet,</hi> which ſheweth that there are ſome numbers and colledges of Ieſuits in England. Neither do ſuch gulles come vpon the ſhore, but when gerat ſtormes are toward. <hi>Sixtly,</hi> the pope hath lately made one <hi>Blackwell</hi> archpreſbyter or gouernor of all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in England, to whom he hath adioyned 12. counſellors &amp; aſſiſtants. It is no ſmall faction therefore, that néedeth ſuch an authority, &amp; ſo many aſſiſtants. <hi>Seuenthly,</hi> theſe fellowes do at the leaſt monthly, and ſometimes oftener receiue from Rome letters and directions, and accordingly make collections of money, giue rules and orders, diſtribute faculties, graines. and medalles, and ſuch like notes of faction. Of one man I haue ſhewed that they receiued two thouſand pounds, that ſcarce euer beſtowed 20. pounds in the Quéenes ſeruice. Here alſo they lay their plots, and ſet men on work not only to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt her Maieſties ſubiects with falſe religion, but alſo with diſloyall affection. <hi>Eightly,</hi> they do monethly, if not oftener, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe into Spaine and Rome, what is done in England, and diſcloſe all the ſecrets both of court and countrey, and from thence vpon any occaſion they hope to draw ayd of men and money. <hi>Ninthly,</hi> as if there were in England no magiſtrates, nor lawes, but ſuch as the pope and Spaniard doth giue them, they are wholly ruled by their officers, directions, and lawes. Nay they contemne her Maieſties lawes and authoritie, as if there were no Quéene nor law in England. From ſorrainers they doe, I ſay, receiue law, and to them they appeale, when
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:177777:229"/> they haue wrong, as appeareth by appellations, letters, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and orders of theirs, which we haue to ſhew. <hi>Tenthly,</hi> in their caſes of conſcience they forbid their conſorts to giue any thing to our vniuerſities, or to pay their due to the miniſters, further then law enforceth them; which argueth, that they worke cloſely againſt the miniſtery and the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. And yet you my maſters of the clergie and the vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties oppoſe not your ſelues againſt this vermine, that ſéeketh to ouerthrow both the Church and vniuerſitie, and is dayly intending and working your ruine. <hi>Eleuenthly,</hi> they ſticke not to declare, how nothing ſtandeth in their way but the Quéenes life. It is not therefore to be doubted but that they are ſtil working againſt her, as the treaſons of <hi>Parſons</hi> &amp; other Ieſuites do manifeſtly declare, and ſome of their letters do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie. Finally they do perceiue ſo litle oppoſition made againſt them, and make all matters ſo ſure on their owne ſide, that now the diſpute is betwixt the Ieſuites and prieſts, who ſhall haue the glory of the conuerſion of England, and how they ſhall diſpoſe of our liuings and landes, and in what ſort our throats muſt be cut, and what forme of gouernement ſhall bée eſtabliſhed in England. No doubt it will be a braue countrey and gouernement, where the Spaniards ſhall enter by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and the Ieſuites be lawgiuers and chiefe gouernours.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore let vs, my deare countrimen, awake out of that dead ſléepe of ſecuritie, into which the pleaſant ſongs of peace, and flattering tales of falſe traitors haue caſt vs. Let vs open our eyes, and looke into the depth of theſe dangerous deuiſes, plotted by a faction plainly profeſſed to be oppoſite to religion and the ſtate. Let vs ſeaze theſe whelpes of wolues, that if they be ſuffered to grow ſtrong and multiply, will deuoure vs. Let vs ſtrangle this brood of vipers, that ſéeke to deſtroy their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that gaue them life. I haue, as you ſée, giuen euerie one of you warning. Now <hi>he that heareth the ſound of the trumpet, and hath no care of himſelfe, when the ſword commeth and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him away, that mans blood ſhall be vpon his owne head,</hi> as the prophet<note n="a" place="margin">Ezech. c. <hi>33.</hi>

But men of iudgement ſuppoſe, that he is of neareſt alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to <hi>Paſquin,</hi> and not vnlike him both in ſhape, maners, and language, as his great practiſe &amp; skill in Paſquinadoes do declare. Wherefore as before I haue encountred this furious fencer in his challenge made to Sir <hi>Fr. Haſtings</hi> in the <hi>Wardword:</hi> ſo here I purpoſe to meete with his turning deuiſes in this <hi>Relation</hi> ſent from Rome to his conſorts in England, with a purpoſe to diſgrace vs. neither do I meane to leaue him, into what forme ſoeuer he ſhal turne himſelf.

                  <p>You may thinke him a ſtrange and variable fellow, that taketh paines, to ſignifie as farre as from Rome into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, what had paſſed hard by our dores, &amp; wherof we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe, but haue more certaine and ſpeedy intelligence, then himſelfe, or others reſiding at Rome. But ſuch is his noble pleaſure. From a fencer, and a Ieſuite, &amp; a great Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin of the Romiſh ſynagogue, he is now turned into a baſe ſcribe, and relator of Romiſh newes: and beleeueth that his report wilbe the rather receiued, eſpecially comming thus turned &amp; diſguiſed from Rome; which is the fountain from whence the popiſh ſect receiue all their traditions. It may be alſo that he hopeth to draw a great hand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs by his triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phing relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the trial paſſed betwixt the L. of <hi>Pleſsis,</hi> &amp; the pretended B. of <hi>Eureux,</hi> which in Rome
<pb facs="tcp:177777:231"/> was heard with great applauſe, and well liked by his holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But if he had better conſidered of the matter, &amp; could haue imagined, that his relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhold haue receiued oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, &amp; his collections, anſwere; I beleeue he would haue ſpared his labor, or rather ſpent it in ſome other libelling diſcourſe; wherin his skil is greater, then in diſputing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For firſt no man can haue leſſe reaſon to exclaime vpon falſifications, &amp; corruptions of ancient authors, then the popiſh ſect. Neither can it proue, but a matter very dangerous to the pope, to haue this point wel examined: whoſe authoritie and doctrine doth for the moſt part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon falſe legends, forged acts of councels, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit writings ſet out vnder the name of fathers, and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous falſifications.

                  <p>Secondly, it wil appeare by examination of particulars, that the L. of <hi>Pleſsis</hi> was moſt vniuſtly charged with falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in his booke publiſhed againſt the maſſe: and that <hi>Iames Peron</hi> pretended biſhop of Eureux, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding all his aduantages, which the kings fauor, and partialitie of the auditorie, and other circumſtances could affoord him, was not able to iuſtifie his challenge.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we will plainly proue, that the popiſh ſect haue gained nothing by this conference but ſhame &amp; confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

For neuer did any ſect either of heretikes or philoſophers vſe ſuch fraude and falſification in maintaining their errors, as the papiſts haue done to make good their moſt abominable doctrine and practiſe. To relate all were a matter of great time and labour. Wée will therefore onely touch ſo much, as may ſerue to prooue them to be moſt culpable in that, whereof they accuſe others.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then wée ſay, and againſt <hi>Parſons</hi> and the whole route of Iebuſites and Cananites, God willing, ſhall prooue, that they haue falſified and corrupted the moſt holie worde of God and his holy Teſtament. For if thoſe which haue hidden, or kept away the Teſtament or laſt will of a mortall man, or haue taken away the ſame by force, or aboliſhed it, or torne it, or made a newe, or written a falſe Teſtament, or vſed it, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, or procured it to bée done; then much more the papiſts that haue falſified Gods eternall worde, are to bée condemned as guiltie of falſhood. But that is confirmed by the words of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe. <hi>Committitur falſum</hi> ſaith the<note n="c" place="margin">ff. de falſis. &amp; Hoſtienſ. de crim. falſ. §. qualiter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittatur. &amp; ad l.

For firſt they haue of a long time hidden Gods worde, as it were a candle vnder a buſhell, and couered it ouer with the plaſter of their traditions and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh interpretations. Secondly they haue remooued the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from the eies of the multitude, and kept the ſame from them in a toong vnknowne, not ſuffring any to read them, but ſuch as they are aſſured will not profite by them. Thirdly ſuch as by any meanes haue gotten them, they haue taken and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſeuerely taking the teſtament of God violently out of their handes. Fourthly they haue<note n="d" place="margin">Index libro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum prohibit.</note> aboliſhed not onely all vulgar, but alſo all Latine tranſlations, except ſuch as they made themſelues. Fiftly they haue burnt, and torne and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:177777:234"/> abuſed Gods holy Teſtament. Sixtly for Gods worde they haue giuen vnto vs a moſt corrupt tranſlation, and made that more authenticall, then the originall. Seuenthly they haue made a falſe teſtament conteined in their vnwritten traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Eightly they will haue no other teſtament exhibited or vſed, or alleaged in ſchooles, but their old Latine vulgar tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation. Laſtly they haue taken away that Sacrament from the people, wherein the newe teſtament is eſtabliſhed, and made fruſtrate Chriſt his inſtitution and laſt will, omitting no meanes that coulde bée deuiſed for the corrupting, falſifying and aboliſhing of Gods eternall teſtament, and the ſeales thereof. Nay certaine<note n="f" place="margin">Matth. Paris.</note> Carmelites about 300. yéeres agone hauing made a teſtament of their owne deuiſe, were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feard to teach, that Chriſtes Goſpell ſhoulde ceaſe, and that their Goſpell ſhoulde for euer after be receiued. <hi>Bonauenture</hi> likewiſe falſifying the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid</hi> turned the praiſes of God to the praiſes of our Ladie.</p>
                     <p>Secondly they haue falſified the canons of the Apoſtles.<note n="g" place="margin">In epiſtola ad Siculos.</note>

                     <p>Thirdly they haue moſt ſhamefully corrupted the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and haue not onely forged diuers new actes, and péeces of actes, but alſo newe councels.

                     <p>Where the ſecond councell of Conſtantinople<note n="a" place="margin">

To end this point, vnder the name of <hi>Sylueſter, Syricius, Gelaſius,</hi> and other popes they haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged whole councels, whereof in authenticall writings there is neither proo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fourthly their manifolde corruptions of the writings of the fathers, cannot in fewe wordes bée deſcribed. Firſt vnder the names of fathers they haue publiſhed moſt childiſh toies, vaine fables, and vnlearned patcheries, as by their additions to the works of <hi>Cyprian, Origen, Athanaſius, Baſill, Ambroſe, Hierome, Auguſtine, Chryſoſtome, Gregorie,</hi> and diuers others, is euidently teſtified. For <hi>Caeſar Baronius, Bellarmine</hi> and others do in part confeſſe ſo much; and if they ſhoulde not, yet woulde the ſtile, and doctrine diuers from that of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to whom they are aſcribed, conuince theſe treatiſes to bee miſbegotten, and not to belong to the fathers, whoſe name they beare: yet are they offended with thoſe, that cenſure theſe counterfeit ſermons, orations, and treatiſes, and ceaſe not to vſe them.</p>
                     <p>Next they haue taken diuers wordes, lines, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:177777:235"/> whole chapters out of the fathers writings, and vnder colour of correcting, haue quite corrupted the fathers.

                     <p>Another practiſe alſo they haue, to abuſe and diſgrace the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the church, that they adde wordes now and then, and alter the text of their true writings; as alſo compariſon of bookes will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fiftly vnder the names of the ancient biſhops of Rome they haue publiſhed méere fooleries, and falſe conſtitutions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed plainly by the ſtories of the times wherein they liued, by the eſtate of that church in time of perſecution, and by the barbarouſneſſe of the Gothike language, wherein they are written, ſauoring of otherages and authors, then thoſe whoſe names they beare.

                     <p>They doe alſo deliuer to vs counterfect doctrine of another ſtamp, and alley, then that of the apoſtles and ancient fathers; and a falſe rule of faith, adding their traditions and the popes determinations to the true rule, and conioyning them to the canonicall Scriptures: of which vnruly rule antiquitie neuer had notice.</p>
                     <p>Neither are they aſhamed to father their owne baſtards, and baſtardly deuiſes vpon <hi>Origen, Cyprian, Athanaſius, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Hierome, Chryſoſtome, Auguſtine, Gregorie,</hi> and other ancient holy men; who if they were aliue, would wonder how theſe miſbegotten deuiſes came to be aſcribed to them: and would vtterly renounce them.</p>
                     <p>In their relations, narrations, hiſtories, and teſtifications publiſhed of late time they neither vſe religion, nor truth, nor common honeſtie. <hi>Caeſar Baronius</hi> doth ſmoothly tell infinite lyes and fables. <hi>Staphilus, Cochleus, Lindanus, Surius, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brard, Bolſecus,</hi> and ſuch like lying mates care not what lyes, or falſe tales they write, ſo they may publiſh any thing, that may redound to the ſclander of the profeſſors of the truth. The like ſhameleſſe courſe hath <hi>Sanders, Riſhton, Ribadineira, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Allen,</hi> and other traytors and enimies of this ſtate, taken, to diſgrace her maieſtie, and her noble progenitors, and all

Such witneſſes as theſe, the popes of Rome and their adherents haue both ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned and hired to ſpeake all manner of ſclandrous vntruthes againſt honeſt men. And theſe are the witneſſes which our aduerſaries ordinarily produce, and whoſe falſe depoſitions they vſe, ſupplying the reſt with falſe and lying fables ſet out by themſelues. Are not they then notorious falſaries?</p>
                     <p>Finally, our aduerſaries take on them to be biſhops, and prieſtes, and euerie begging and baſe fryer is bold to vſurpe paſtorall function. Nay, the popes of Rome vſurpe, not onely the authoritie of biſhops, hauing nothing but the bare name of biſhops; but alſo the authoritie and prerogatiues of Chriſt Ieſus, falſely appropriating that to themſelues, that is onely due to Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                     <p>The popes of Rome therefore and their agents, conſorts, and adherents are notorious falſificators, and haue ſurpaſſed all the world in fraud, forgerie and falſhood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that ſhall <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> the relator, or rather delator and falſe accuſer of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren well perceiue, if he dare encounter theſe obiections.</p>

For albeit <hi>Scotus</hi> had not ſo done, or ſpoken; yet could not the Lord of <hi>Pleſſis</hi> be charged with falſification, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he doth not quote his words, but ſet downe his owne col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. The moſt that could be ſaid was, that he had miſtaken the meaning of <hi>Scotus.</hi> And yet if he had charged him only with miſtaking, himſelfe had beene miſtaken, and greatly had he wronged his aduerſary. For it cannot be denied, but that <hi>Scotus</hi> doth indéed call into queſtion, <hi>whether Chriſts body be really by tranſubſtantiation contained vnder the formes of bread and wine,</hi> and diſputeth <hi>that it is not:</hi> which is all that the Lord of <hi>Pleſſis</hi> doth ſay of <hi>Scotus,</hi> for which he is challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by his wrangling aduerſarie.

He doth alſo argue ſtrongly againſt tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation out of ſcriptures, and anſwereth his owne argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments verie weakely and coldly, and in the end affirmeth, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:177777:239"/> the determination of the Church of Rome did principally moue him to beléeue the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation. Of which it followeth very neceſſarily, albeit he was content to ſubſcribe to the Popes determination, and durſt not do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, yet that he himſelfe thought otherwiſe for the reaſons by him alleaged, and ſo not we onely, but <hi>Dominicke a Soto</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it: againſt whom <hi>Ioſephus Angles</hi> a Scotiſt laboureth much to defend <hi>Scotus,</hi> as not diſſenting from the church of Rome; and yet ſatiſfieth no man ſoundly.</p>

Not the firſt, for that hee doth not alleage <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> words, but maketh a collection vpon them. Not the ſecond for that as <hi>M.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:177777:240"/> ſéeing he concludeth of the words, and doth not rehearſe them preciſely, he had no reaſon to write all downe that came in his way. It is alſo obiected, <hi>that Chryſoſtome alloweth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of ſaints.</hi> But be it he did ſo, yet doth not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, that he is falſly alleaged by <hi>M.

                     <p>The fourth place was taken out of a certaine Homily of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> vpon <hi>Matthew,</hi> where, as the L. of <hi>Pleſſis</hi> allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, he ſaith <hi>we haue much more aſſurance through our owne prayers, then through the prayers of others, and that God ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs, not ſo ſoone at others requeſts, as at our own.</hi> And this the aduerſarie himſelfe could not denie to be truly alleaged. How then came it to paſſe, that dealing thus iuſtly and truly, he ſhould notwithſtanding be charged with falſification? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth ſaith his aduerſarie, becauſe he left out the words follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, viz. <hi>Et haec non dicimus, vt ſupplicandum ſanctis nege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi> and for that he applied <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> wordes againſt prayers to ſaints departed. As if it were ſo haynous a matter, not to ſet downe words altogether impertinent: or as if it did not follow, that we are not to rely vpon ſaints prayers, and that therefore we are not ſo continually to pray to ſaints, and ſo to truſt to their interceſſion, as the church of Rome doth, that maketh prayers to ſaints a great péece of their Church-ſeruice. But were it that the argument were not good, yet the aduerſarie will not graunt, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his conſorts do commit falſifications, as oft as they bring weake, or euil-ſhapen arguments. It was alſo further anſwered, that <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> had nothing, that might force vs to beléeue that hée taught or beléeued prayers to Saints departed; which may ſerue fully to anſwere all the aduerſaries vaine cauillations.</p>
                     <p>The fift obiection was, for that citing theſe words out of <hi>Hieroms</hi> commentaries vpon <hi>Ezechiel lib.</hi> 4. <hi>in cap.</hi> 14. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt confidere in Domino, &amp;c.</hi> he left out theſe wordes, <hi>ſi negligentes fuerint.</hi> But<note n="d" place="margin">Falſum non committitur ſine dolo.</note> no falſification can be committed without fraud. Now what fraud could be imagined in omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wordes that make nothing for his aduerſarie, or againſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:177777:240"/> himſelfe? Beſide that the ordinarie gloſſe doth rehearſe theſe words no otherwiſe, then the Lord of <hi>Pleſſis</hi> quoteth them, whom I thinke the <hi>Malheureux</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Eureux</hi> will not charge with falſification. It was alſo here obiected, <hi>that Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms words in Ezech. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>make nothing againſt prayers to ſaints.</hi> But it muſt be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie here was not, whether <hi>M.

                     <p>The ſixt place, which the Lord of <hi>Pleſſis</hi> was charged, to haue corrupted, was drawne out of <hi>Cyril contra Iulianum lib.</hi> 6. And why was he charged thinke you? Forſooth becauſe hée alleaged him to proue, <hi>that adoration was not to be yeelded to the ſigne of the croſſe.</hi> But herein there could not be any fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſification vſed; and that firſt, for that he did not alleage the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors words: and ſecondly, for that he doth well conclude ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Cyrils</hi> meaning. For where <hi>Iulian</hi> obiected to Chriſtians, that they worſhipped the croſſe: <hi>Cyril</hi> anſwereth, <hi>that theſe words proceeded of bad thoughts, and extreme ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</hi> So likewiſe ſaith <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> in his apology; <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces nec adoramus nec optamus.</hi> That is, we neither worſhip, nor deſire croſſes.</p>
                     <p>The ſeuenth place was out of <hi>Petrus Crinitus;</hi> where the L. of <hi>Pleſſis</hi> is charged to leaue out the word <hi>humi,</hi> alleaging the law of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> againſt the making of the ſigne of the croſſe. But his accuſers ſhould haue remembred, that he did alleage not the words, as now they are found in bookes falſified by idolaters, and croſſe-worſhippers, but out
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:177777:241"/> of <hi>Petrus Crinitus,</hi> which citeth the law out of authenticall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. Our wiſe relator here, to make the matter ſéeme more heinous, ſaith he falſified the law of <hi>Theodoſius, Valens,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian;</hi> as if they had béene ioynt authors of that law, when as <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> was not yet in the world, when that law was made. Neither is it much materiall, if <hi>Tribonian</hi> in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours name had put in the word <hi>humi.</hi> For we are rather to rely vpon the originals, then vpon <hi>Tribonians</hi> honeſtie, that put words in and out, and altered lawes at pleaſure. Neither was the law of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> to be reputed new, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the word <hi>Humi</hi> had béene left out, ſéeing both <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and the councell of <hi>Eliberis</hi> in Spaine, and diuers other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had condemned paintings of images.</p>
                     <p>The eight place was taken out of S. <hi>Bernard, Epiſt.</hi> 174. <hi>ſhe needeth no falſe honors,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> ſpeaking of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary, being as ſhe is, at the fulneſſe therof.</hi> Againe he ſaith <hi>that it was no honour, but a taking away of honor,</hi> and, <hi>that the feaſt of her conception was neuer well inſtituted.</hi> Here his accuſer charged the Lord of <hi>Pleſſis</hi> to haue omitted theſe words, <hi>Magnifica gratiae inuentricem, mediatricem ſalutis, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauratricem ſeculorum.</hi> As if it were neceſſarie, where diuers places are alleaged out of one authour, to write out all that commeth betwixt one &amp; other. This is a new trick of <hi>Eureux,</hi> who albeit he<note place="margin">He hath ſet out a treatiſe to proue this poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> hold <hi>the ſcriptures to be inſufficient,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hath tried his poore talent of writing; yet would haue more then is ſufficient alleaged out of fathers and other authours.

Thoſe reaſons therefore, that are forcible againſt the idols of the Gentiles, are alſo moſt forcible againſt the popiſh worſhip of images: which is more groſſe idolatrie in ſome pointes, then that of the heathens. For they neuer did giue that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that is due to the originall, to the image. But the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous papiſtes with one worſhip honour the holy Trinitie, and the image of the Trinitie made by a painter: our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt, and a woodden crucifixe.

                     <argument>
                        <p>That our aduerſaries haue no ſuch great cauſe, as they imagine, to boaſt of their victorie in the conference paſſed betwixt the Lord of Pleſſis, and Eureux.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y this which hath béene ſpoken it may ſufficiently appéere, that the papiſtes had no great reaſon to make <hi>Parſons</hi> the Iebuſite their trumpet to blow out their victory throughout England, as they haue alreadie done it at Rome, and in other places. For what victory can be pretended, when as yet not one corruption or falſification coulde bée iuſtified againſt <hi>Monſieur Pleſſis,</hi> and when wée are able to charge not onely <hi>Bellarmine, Caeſar Baronius, Gregorie de Valentia, Sanders, Harding, Stapleton</hi> and their conſorts, whoſe forgeries and falſifications are innumerable, but alſo their holy fathers, whoſe determinations they hold to bée in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, with infinite wilfull falſifications? And leaſt anie thinke wée fable, of many wée haue begun to note ſome fewe.</p>
                     <p>The vanitie of their triumph may alſo appéere by diuers other arguments. Firſt our cauſe dependeth not vpon the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of <hi>Scotus,</hi> nor <hi>Durand,</hi> nor <hi>Petrus Crinitus.</hi> No, nor vpon two or thrée teſtimonies of this or that father. But vpon the euidence of Canonicall Scriptures, &amp; teſtimony of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church of all times, which wée doubt not to prooue both by the ſcriptures themſelues, and alſo by the interpretation &amp; conſent of the moſt ancient and ſounde fathers. As for the writings of other fathers, wée examine them by the rule of Gods worde, and receiue them as farre, as they agrée with the rule and foundation of faith. The teſtimonie of later wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and ſchoolemen wée produce, as a confeſſion of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries againſt themſelues, and not as a foundation or neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie defence of the truth, which they in ſo many pointes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne. They are therefore put in, to fill vp the rankes of our ſquadrons, rather then to do vs any great ſeruice: and rather
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:177777:243"/> becauſe our aduerſaries eſtéeme them; then becauſe we thinke them woorthie to bée eſtéemed. If then theſe authorities had béene ouerthrowne, which is not granted, yet all our other ſquadrons ſtanding firme, the aduerſaries cannot think they haue woonne the field.</p>
                     <p>Secondly admit one learned man of our ſocietie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion had miſtaken ſome fewe places; yet is not euery miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking a falſification, vnleſſe it be wilfull and fraudulent; nor is euery particular mans errour to be aſcribed to the whole church. Nay albeit <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> be now Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and men of note among the papiſtes; yet will not <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> I trow, take on him to defende, whatſoeuer they haue written. And albeit ſuch a ſhameleſſe mate ſhoulde not doubt to vndertake any impoſſibilitie; yet the popes of Rome will not abide by all they haue written. Why then ſhoulde they vrge vs to that, which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues miſlike in their owne cauſe?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly the place and forme of triall and procéeding was all in fauour of the aduerſarie, and diſfauour of the Lorde of <hi>Pleſſis.</hi> For neither had hée ſufficient time to conſider of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters obiected, and to prouide himſelfe of bookes to iuſtifie his aſſertions, nor ſo indifferent iudges as was to be deſired, the king ſtil interrupting him, and diſputing againſt him, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the iudges which way it pleaſed himſelfe. Nor was the auditorie indifferent, being for the moſt part of contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Nor coulde he by any humble requeſt obtaine, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his aduerſarie might preciſely be tied to his challenge, or that his booke might be examined orderly, or any thing elſe, that is requiſite in an indifferent triall.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly if a gentleman and no profeſſed diuine vpon ſuch vnequall termes was able to make head againſt his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; much better, I hope, ſhoulde we be able to reſiſt, if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Diuines, might procure an indifferent triall allowed by both ſides; and more hardly woulde the aduerſaries bée able to make good their challenges againſt vs. Certes if <hi>Eureux</hi> coulde not ſo well acquite himſelfe before iudges determined to iudge for him, he woulde neuer be able to appéere in a frée generall councell, or before equall iudges.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly it is moſt ridiculous to thinke, that this Thraſoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call challenger was able to make good that cauſe, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with lying, forging, facing, nor any wit or policie, the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:177777:244"/> greateſt clerkes of that faction are able to maintaine.</p>
                     <p>Finally the very wordes of <hi>Eureux</hi> his challenge, do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuict him to haue performed nothing. <hi>I do binde my ſelfe</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">In his anſwere and offer made to Monſieur Pleſſis.</note> ſaith hée, <hi>to ſhewe, that neither in this booke of his againſt the maſſe, nor in his treatiſe of the church, nor in his common wealth of traditions, is there to be founde ſo much, as one place among them all, which is not either falſely cited, or imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the matter, or vnprofitably alleaged.</hi> Againe <hi>He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth and bindeth himſelfe to ſhewe fiue hundred enormous and open falſifications, without any amplification or exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and all theſe conteined in M. Pleſſis his onely late booke againſt the maſſe.</hi> And this hée ſaide hée woulde prooue by Gréeke and Latine copies. But hée ſpoke theſe wordes, as it ſhoulde ſeeme, more of brauerie, then out of iudgement. for in the firſt part hee hath vtterly failed, and I thinke mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth neuer to performe it. If hée would bée pleaſed, we would be glad to ſée his Latine and Gréeke allegations, and all that performed, which he promiſed in writing. But many doubt of his abilitie, and himſelfe too no leſſe then others. For being deſired, <hi>To examine M. Pleſſis his booke leafe by leafe, and in order, he vtterly refuſed that courſe.</hi> The ſecond part he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to handle, but hath no way accompliſhed his promiſe. For promiſing to ſhew 500. enormous falſifications, he onely quoted 60. places, whereof onely nine were examined, and yet no falſification prooued, but onely in <hi>Eureux</hi> his challenge. If then the defendant is to bée acquited, where the plaintife prooueth nothing, or not ſo much as hée affirmeth; then is <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reux</hi> to bée condemned, that in his challenge braggeth much, alleageth little, and prooueth nothing.</p>
                     <p>In the meane while our relator may do well to ceaſe his vaine facing and vanting. For vnleſſe hée triumph to couer his owne ſhame and loſſe; there will bée no cauſe of triumph for him founde in this triall. It is not the vaine boaſting, nor the falſe report of this relator, that can turne truth into falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and falſhood into truth. When <hi>Eureux</hi> or any other of his conſorts ſhall go about to performe his challenge in writing, which wel cannot be denied nor altered; he ſhall finde that the Lord of <hi>Pleſſis</hi> will bee both able and moſt readie to defende himſelfe againſt all the calumniations of his aduerſaries; and for the truth of his cauſe hée ſhall neuer want aſſiſtance, as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:177777:244"/> long as God ſhall enable vs to ſpeake or write. The Kinges pleaſure in cenſuring <hi>M. Pleſſis</hi> we will not examine. Neither do I thinke the aduerſaries will allow him to be iudge in their cauſe. The papiſtes therefore muſt deuiſe ſome better mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to grace their Romiſh cauſe, then this. For neither the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of matters at <hi>Fontainebleau,</hi> nor this relation can helpe them any thing.</p>

                        <hi>Peter Martyr for alledging ten ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fathers in his diſputation at Oxford anno</hi> 1549. <hi>and yet not any one of them truly.</hi> But he is but a ridiculous diſputer, that layeth ten falſifications to a mans charge, and prooueth not one. Nay, he doth not ſo much as cite one place, and note the poynt, wherein this outrage is committed. Onely he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, <hi>that he hath examined their diligently.</hi> As if that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any thing to the purpoſe. He ſaith alſo, <hi>that if any liſt to examine the places, and confer them with the authors bookes, he ſhall finde his ſaying moſt true.</hi> But all the falſhood, we can finde, is in our aduerſaries relation. He may therefore do wel, to take himſelfe leiſure, and to come better armed, or elſe to forbeare to charge honeſt men with his owne faults. He ſaith further, <hi>that this falſification may chaunce to appeere vpon ſome other occaſion hereafter.</hi> Vnto which we anſwer, that we will attend his maſhips leiſure, and when we can heare what he will obiect, then he ſhall heare our defence. In the meane while we tell him, that <hi>Parſons</hi> cannot face out that with wordes, which with force of argument he cannot obtaine: and that he muſt be a ſimple diuine, that feareth to encounter ſo vaine a bragger.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he affirmeth, <hi>that biſhop</hi>

                        <hi>Ridley in a diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the reall preſence, wherein he was preſident (Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Bucer refuſing to deale in that matter) ſaid he had fiue ſure grounds for the opinion of Zuinglius, viz. Scripture, fathers, &amp;c. Whereas the truth is, that both Scriptures and fathers make euidently againſt him.</hi> Which manner of obiecting if it were ſufficient to conuince him of falſhood; then might all <hi>Bellarmines</hi> workes in thrée lines be refuted and conuicted of falſhood. For albeit he make great ſhew of Scriptures and fathers; yet neither the one nor the other make for him. Nay, we doubt not, but if we may haue indifferent iudges, to turne them both againſt him. Wherefore if this brabling relator will effect his purpoſe; he muſt note the places falſified, and prooue it to his readers. In the meane while in this narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſheweth himſelfe to be, not onely a forger of lyes, but alſo a ſimple fellow to vndertake this challenge againſt vs concerning falſifications. The firſt is prooued <hi>firſt,</hi> for that the diſputation was not againſt the reall preſence, but againſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:177777:245"/> tranſubſtantiation And I doubt not but <hi>Parſons</hi> doth well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that diuers doe hold the reall preſence, and that but too really and materially, &amp; yet impugne tranſubſtantiation: or elſe in theſe matters he is but a verie nouice. Secondly, for that <hi>B. Ridley</hi> did not once mention <hi>Zuinglius</hi> nor his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but only determined againſt tranſubſtantiation. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that <hi>Bucer</hi> refuſed not to deale in that matter. For it appéereth, that others were appointed to diſpute in that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and that he was neither appointed, nor requeſted to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute. The ſecond may be prooued, for that this ignorant fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low doth not well vnderſtand, what falſification meaneth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he be cunning in the practiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he imagineth them to be falſaries, that alleage places, that make either not for them, or againſt them. But ſuch are rather weake diſputers, then falſaries, if they doe not corrupt, or curtall the words, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of authors. Againe, obiecting againſt ſo reuerend a man falſification of Scriptures &amp; fathers, he bringeth not ſo much as one word of proofe, but onely his bare word, which weyeth not the weight of one fether with any man of credit.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, he inueigheth againſt biſhop <hi>Iewell, as if he had ſo falſified all authors by him cited in his bookes, that all that red them with indifferencie, albeit proteſtants before, turned pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piſtes.</hi> And for proofe he alleageth the examples of <hi>Copley, Steuens, &amp; Reynoldes.</hi> But he is too too much abuſed, if he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe fellowes, either euer to haue béene grounded in true religion, or that they did read <hi>B. Iewels</hi> bookes with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie, or that no man red them with indifferencie, but theſe thrée, or ſuch others, as turned papiſtes. Nay I cannot learne, but that <hi>Copley</hi> (whom here, to grace his witneſſe, he dubbeth a Baron with his quill; yet a Baron without a Baronrie) and that <hi>Reinoldes</hi> and <hi>Stephens</hi> were in hart papiſtes, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, percaſe, for worldly reſpects they might diſſemble it. But were they, or were they not, it is not greatly materiall. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this is moſt apparent, that Biſhop <hi>Iewels</hi> bookes haue too long paſſed for currant, to be conuinced of falſhood by ſuch a ſimple diſputer as <hi>Parſons,</hi> and by ſuch ſimple grounds, as hée alleageth. The bookes are lately tranſlated into Latin. If hée thinke he can ſay anie thing more againſt them; let vs know his pleaſure in his next Pamphlet. And let him not doubt, but he ſhall finde diuers, that will defend that learned biſhop, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:177777:246"/> painefull labourer in Gods church againſt the barking of all the helhounds of the Romiſh ſynagogue, and prooue him an honeſter man in his allegations, then either <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or <hi>Greg. de Valentia,</hi> or <hi>Caeſar Baronius,</hi> or any of their conſorts. And finally that all the obiections of the aduerſaries againſt him, are either lies or méere fooleries.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, he barketh lowdly againſt maſter <hi>Foxe</hi> nowe dead, againſt whom while he liued, greater dogs then he durſt not once grinne with their téeth. Againſt him he alleageth, <hi>that there is no whole ſtorie in his booke, but it is falſified or peruerted.</hi> But what a ſhameleſſe fellow is this, that affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth all the booke to he full of falſifications, when he doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alleage one ſtorie, nor conuince him of one falſhood? One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſaith, <hi>that a certaine learned ſcholler brought to him of late</hi> 30. <hi>places taken out of two onely leaues of maſter Foxe his booke, to wit from the</hi> 12. <hi>to the</hi> 14. <hi>leafe all falſified; and that himſelfe found ſo many more, as might double the foreſaide number, and doth offer to prooue them one by one to anie friend of maſter Foxes:</hi> and ſo falling to multiplication, he ſaith, <hi>that if</hi> 60. <hi>be multiplied by a thouſand and more according to the number of leaues of the booke there will fall out the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of</hi> 30000. <hi>falſhoods, and that maſter Foxes booke will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede Iohn Sleidans, in number of lyes.</hi> But all this amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to nothing, but vaine words. When he commeth to his tryall, he ſhall finde, that neither the ſcholler, nor the <hi>Rector</hi> is able to conuince maſter <hi>Foxe</hi> of falſhood. Which alſo may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péere by view of thoſe leaues, which he quoteth. For therein maſter <hi>Foxe</hi> ſcarce quoteth any allegations, but onely briefely noteth certaine abſurd opinions held by papiſtes: in which when <hi>Parſons</hi> ſhall come forth and ſpeake <hi>de tracta perſona,</hi> he ſhall finde, that maſter <hi>Foxe</hi> hath ſaid truely, and that thoſe abſurdities, which he noteth, follow indeed of popiſh doctrine. If then thoſe leaues, where our aduerſarie ſuppoſeth moſt falſhood, will be iuſtified againſt the calumniations of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Engliſh ſeminarie of traytors, and all his diſciples, I beléeue his reckonings and accounts of falſhoodes wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:177777:246"/>
                     <p>He taketh alſo exception againſt maſter <hi>Foxes</hi> calender, as if he meant to canonize all there mentioned; and chargeth him with other trickes and ſhifts. But the calender was onely placed there to note the day of euerie mans triall and ſuffring: and ſo far was he from ſhifting &amp; tricking, that no man coulde deale more plainely, as ſhall bee iuſtified againſt this Braga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doccio and his conſorts, come he foorth when he dare. Nay the trickings and deluſions of the whore of Babylon together with her bloodie cruelties, which maſter <hi>Foxe</hi> hath layde open to the world, ſhall yet be made more manifeſt, if once they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to quarrell. Likewiſe we will bring forth ſo many lyes out of papiſticall writers, as ſhall make our aduerſaries wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of this argument. Of <hi>Sleidan</hi> I néede not ſay much, ſéeing he hath anſwered ſufficiently for himſelfe, and ouerturned the cart loaded with lyes by his accuſers againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Againſt maſter <hi>D. Fulke</hi> our accuſer obiecteth nothing, ſo that by rules of law this accuſer is to be condemned of calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niation, and <hi>D. Fulke</hi> to be diſcharged from further moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And thus much may ſerue to ſhew the vanitie of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries crackes and bragges of the great miſchiefe he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to vs, in conuincing vs, as he hopeth, of falſification. For what ſhould many words néede to anſwere ſo vaine a babler, that albeit he accuſe many, and layeth to their charge a moſt heinous crime, yet neither noteth, nor prooueth any one point againſt them? Beſide that, noting certaine places in maſter <hi>Foxe,</hi> moſt ridiculouſly he would haue vs to anſwere, before he obiect any thing, or ſhew the points of falſhood. Which is a more abiurd courſe, then that of <hi>Eureux</hi> againſt <hi>M. Pleſſis,</hi> who of many places noted ſome, and laide downe his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But this relator hath not his arguments yet framed. So buſie hée is about plotting ſome miſchieuous deuiſe or treaſon.</p>

For albeit the iuſtice of our cauſe, and the vaine brags, falſe dealing, &amp; ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous cauillations of papiſts may ſufficiently be diſcouered by that, which already hath béene anſwered; yet ſhal the ſame more exactly be prooued and diſcerned, if we doe but lightly touch euery point of his pamphlet in order as it lyeth, and as our lying aduerſary hath couched it in his letters from Rome.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of his aduertiſements he yéeldeth two reaſons, that moued him to ſend the report of the conference paſſed in Fraunce ſo farre as from Rome into England. The firſt was, <hi>for that euery man vnderſtood not the French tongue; and few durſt tranſlate and diuulge ſuch matters in Engliſh.</hi> The ſecond is, <hi>that men might vnderſtand the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the combate, and true iſſue thereof, and ſuch things as paſſed therein, from authenticall parties.</hi> But theſe pretended reaſons ſéeme to be full of ridiculous vanitie, and voide of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For albeit euerie man vnderſtood not French, yet might he either learne of others, or himſelfe reade the treatiſes publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in Engliſh concerning that matter ſome time before the comming of this relation. Againe, it is a very ridiculous point to think, that French matters are better vnderſtood at Rome, then in France, or that we are like to haue better intelligence from Rome, that, as <hi>Petrarch</hi> called her, is <hi>Fucina d'inganni, e ſchola d'errori,</hi> that is, a forge of lyes and trecherous frauds, and a ſchoole of errors, and hereſies, and falſhood, then out of the place where theſe matters were executed, which are héere reported. Finally, nothing can be deuiſed more abſurd, then to account <hi>Iames Peron</hi> his letters in his owne cauſe, or the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:177777:247"/> Popes Nuntioes letters in a matter, that ſo néere touched the Pope, to be <hi>authenticall,</hi> or of any credit. It is a common rule, that <hi>no man is a ſufficient witneſſe in his owne cauſe.</hi> And iuſt exceptions may be taken to al partial witneſſes. Wherefore to write fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome into England of French matters, was a trick of foolerie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſend the parties letters for authenticall teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, was a ridiculous abſurditie. No it was no part of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators intention, either to haue truth knowne, or authenticall narrations diuulged, but rather with vaine reports &amp; lies ſent from Rome, that is now become a miſtreſſe of lies, to croſſe and blemiſh truth, and thoſe that profeſſe the ſame. For which cauſe I haue alſo thought conuenient to entertaine the relator with this anſwer, which I doubt not but <hi>Blackwel</hi> the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſbyter or archtraitor, and <hi>Walley</hi> the prouinciall of Iebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites in this countrey will ſend him.</p>

For wée know the men farre better then he: and that as the Lord of <hi>Pleſſis</hi> is a man of great worth and learning, ſo <hi>Eureux</hi> is an apoſtate from religion, and a vainglorious man.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:177777:248"/> of his booke written againſt the Maſſe, as if our cauſe did ſtand vpon that booke, or any other mans worke.

                     <p>Hauing talked his pleaſure of the parties, our relator de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth to diſcourſe of the occaſions of the conference: but hée ſhould much diſſent from himſelfe, if he ſhould tell truth. For where he ſaith, <hi>that after that diuers examining the booke of the Lord of Pleſſis had found many moſt egregious falſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and had cried out againſt them in pulpit, the king &amp; diuers noble men that were proteſtants, as namely the duke of Bullion, Roſni, Deſguieres, and others began to call vpon the triall of M. Pleſſis his booke, for that it ſeemed to touch all their honours, and of their religion eſpecially:</hi> There is ſcarce any ſhadow of truth, or honeſt dealing. For firſt the charge of <hi>egregious falſifications,</hi> and of <hi>thouſands of falſhoods,</hi> ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be prooued againſt <hi>M. Pleſſis</hi> his writings. But if we liſt to examine the lying decretals of popes, the fabulous legends of the ſynagogue of Rome, the cogging commentaries of <hi>Caeſar Baronius,</hi> &amp; the iangling diſputes of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> &amp; his conſorts, we ſhall eaſily find here that number of falſifications, which the aduerſaries ſéek other where. Secondly, it is a moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe vntruth to ſay, that either the king or any other, ſaue the Lord of <hi>Pleſſis</hi> himſelfe, and the Duke of <hi>Bullion,</hi> that exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his ſupplication to the king, did deſire any ſuch triall. For if the king had called vpon this triall, what ſhould <hi>M. Pleſſis</hi> haue néeded to employ all his friends, to procure, that he might haue an hearing? And what reaſon had either <hi>Roſni</hi> or <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guieres</hi> to deale in a matter that pertained not to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Thirdly it is a ridiculous conceit to thinke, that al theſe noblemens ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſtood vpon the credite of a booke, that was written by another, or that our religion could not ſtand without the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this treatiſe, though otherwiſe neuer ſo excellent. But this is but a tricke of <hi>Parſons</hi> cunning, to aduance the fame of his ſuppoſed victorie. It is alſo a moſt manifeſt vntruth, <hi>that

                     </p>
                     <p>Neither doth he obſerue more religion in relating the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and iſſue of the triall, where he ſaith, <hi>that the day being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the conference, M.

For if <hi>M. Pleſſis</hi> had either ſhrunke, or vſed any tergiuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he would not ſo earneſtly haue ſolicited this trial. Nay albeit he perceiued the king to be made againſt him very plainly, &amp; that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions of the conference were ſo vnequal for him, that ſcarce any would haue yéelded to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; yet did he reſolue to procéed, &amp; ſhut his eies againſt all difficulties, bearing himſelfe bold vpon his owne innocencie, and refuſing to heare thoſe, that willed him either to deſiſt, or to obtaine more equall conditions of tryall.<note n="b" place="margin">A diſcourſe of the conference at Fontaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau.</note> But whatſoeuer <hi>M.

Finally, <hi>Eureux</hi> being chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged priuatly made a publike matter of it, as being vnable to deale hand to hand with his aduerſarie: and could neuer be drawn to performe his challenge, either in refuting the whole
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:177777:249"/> booke, or ſhewing 500. falſifications to be contained in the booke. All that were preſent alſo can witneſſe, that <hi>M. Pleſſis</hi> had neither fower nor fiue, nor any one to ſpeake in his cauſe being ſtill vrged, not onely by his aduerſarie, whoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he weyed not, but alſo by the king, againſt whom his purpoſe was not to make himſelfe partie. Finally, to whom the victorie belonged, may appéere by that which hath béene ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he was condemned both by his owne friends, and by the iudges, and that our ſide was ſo diſmaide, as is reported, is vtterly vntrue: as both the euents and effects ſhew, and thoſe that were preſent are readie to teſtifie.</p>
                     <p>After this our relator taketh paines to ſet downe firſt the challenges on each ſide, and <hi>M. Pleſſis</hi> his reply. Next the kings letters, <hi>Iames Perons</hi> owne report, and the <hi>Nuntioes</hi> and an others letter ſent to Rome. Out of which I maruell what he is able to gather for his owne aduantage; or not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his diſadua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage. For by <hi>Perons</hi> offer made to <hi>M. Pleſſis</hi> in his anſwere to his challenge, it appéereth that he hath fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in performing it. By <hi>M. Pleſſis</hi> his reply we gather, that he could not obtaine any indifferent tryall. The kings iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matters of religion is not allowed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduerſaries themſelues. The glorious challenger in his letters to Rome compareth his king to <hi>Hunnericus</hi> an Arian heretike and a perſecutor of the church: And ſaith, that as <hi>Eugenius</hi> biſhop of <hi>Carthage</hi> would not diſpute with the Arians without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the biſhop of Rome acquainted; albeit required by <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nericus</hi> king of Vandals: ſo he would do nothing without the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of the biſhop of Rome, before the French king. In other points, neither his letters, nor the popes <hi>Nuntioes</hi> letters, nor that other good fellowes letters deſerue any credit. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, all this great ſtirre which <hi>Parſons</hi> maketh about no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, doth ſhew the great pouertie of the aduerſaries cauſe, that as men wracked at ſea, are glad to lay hold vpon euerie broken planke to ſaue their liues.</p>

                        <p>The notorious vanitie of the relators obſeruations vpon the former narration is detected.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter our relator had truſſed vp his far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of fooleries, to make the ſame more vendible, he garniſheth his packet with certaine painted gloſſes, which hee ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>obſeruations.</hi> And to make his eloquence ſéeme more admirable, hée doth excorticate certaine Latin words according to his Romiſh faſhion, <hi>refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>what occurred to his contemplation.</hi> Which reflections, occurrents, obſeruations and contemplations, to do him pleaſure, we are content particularly to conſider, and ſée whether he were not in a ſounde ſléepe, when he thought himſelfe to be in a profound contemplation. And firſt verie wiſely he obſerueth <hi>Gods prouidence in conſeruation &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the olde catholike faith deliuered firſt at the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Sauiour, vnto his viſible Church,</hi> as he ſaith. But if he ſpeake of Chriſts faith, then this obſeruation co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth him nothing. For that faith hath alwaies continued, and ſhall continue, notwithſtanding the oppoſition of the Iebuſites and Cananites, and all their adherents, and néedeth neither their letters, diſputes, nor practiſes, to preſerue it. If he ſpeake of the Romiſh faith, as it is no queſtion but hée doth; then wée muſt tell him, that wée denie that that faith is either the catholike faith, or was deliuered at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of Chriſt his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or in many ages after, to any Church, or procéeded euer from the apoſtles. We doe therefore here obſerue, that hée is but a bad obſeruer, that marketh no better, what was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Chriſt and his apoſtles. Againe wée obſerue, that it is a ſtrange faſhion of ſpéech to ſay, that the faith began to bée deliuered firſt at Chriſt his aſcenſion. For then it followeth, that not onely the apoſtles before that time, but alſo the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes and prophets ſhoulde either be deuoide of faith, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued without faith, which is impious to ſay, or that they had faith before it firſt began. It is alſo a ſtrange doctrine to ſaie,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:177777:250"/> that the apoſtles at the aſcenſion of Chriſt deliuered the faith to the viſible church. For that church is not now viſible, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was that church, that is now, viſible then. Naie to ſaie that the whole catholike church is viſible, is an aſſertion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant as well to reaſon, as to Chriſtian faith.</p>
                     <p>Hée obſerueth alſo, <hi>That though new fantaſies and deuiſes of particular men haue ſprong vp with freſh and gliſtering ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, that in the end God bringeth the ſame to confuſion.</hi> All which wée hope will prooue true in the glorious ruffle of the Iebuſites and Romiſh ſynagogue. For albeit theſe wicked Cananites will bée termed Ieſuites, and do pretend perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in themſelues, and reformation in others; yet their glorie beginneth to fade, and their trecherous and Machiauelian practiſes begin to bée diſcouered not onely by vs, but by their owne conſorts. The ſynagogue of Rome alſo, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of antichriſt, albeit it hath long triumphed, &amp; troden the truth vnder foote, yet beginneth to decay, and is now oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of many, and in the end ſhall bée ouerthrowne. It reſteth onely, that they looke for <hi>aeternum opprobrium,</hi> of which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſpeaketh. Finally the golden idole of the maſſe is now in moſt places aboliſhed and where it remaineth, is not valued at thrée-halfepence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This obſeruation therefore maketh much againſt the obſeruer, and againſt vs nothing: and is verie farre wide from the matter of this conference, out of which theſe obſeruations ſhoulde be drawne.</p>
                     <p>The third point that hée obſerueth is, <hi>That the ſhame and confuſion of heretikes and hereſies conſiſteth principally in</hi> 4. <hi>points, as holy fathers do note, viz. Firſt in diuiſion among themſelues; ſecondly in contradiction of ſectaries; thirdly in atheiſme and coldneſſe of religion; fourthly in open lying and falſifications of authors to ſerue their purpoſe.</hi> But hée leaueth out the very principall cauſe of the confuſion of heretikes. And that is partly for that they ſéeke their owne glorie, and not the truth, &amp; partly for that forſaking the direction of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they follow lying legendes and fables, falſe traditions, vaine opinions and determinations of popes, and humane fanſies. Neither is hée ſo well verſed in fathers, that hée can tell what they ſay. Theſe 4. points certes which he alleageth, the fathers do not ſay alwaies to bée proper to heretikes. For neither are all heretikes diuided into partes, nor do all ſeeme
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:177777:250"/> colde in religion, (ſome pretending ſuperfluous and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious zeale) neither haue all heretikes vſed open falſification and lying. When hée commeth to exhibite the fathers which hée pretendeth, I beléeue he will be driuen to falſifie them, or elſe they will not ſerue his purpoſe. But were it granted, that theſe qualities are incident to heretikes, yet doth the ſame make little for the aduerſaries aduantage, who are diuided into diuers ſectes and religions, and infinite diuers opinions, and are not onely atheiſtes, but alſo the groſſeſt liers and falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficators of authors, that euer were heard of in any recorde or hiſtorie. With their atheiſme alſo they ioine ſuperſtition and idolatrie, and defende their matters not onely with falſhoode and fraude, but alſo with fine force and crueltie.</p>
                     <p>As for thoſe of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, they cannot iuſtly be charged either with contradiction, or diuiſion, or impiety or falſificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either by <hi>Parſons</hi> or by his two friends <hi>Reſcius</hi> and <hi>William Reynoldes:</hi> as hath béene ſhewed in a treatiſe called <hi>Turcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſmus,</hi> wherin the ſpite of thoſe two dogs that haue long bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked againſt religion, and belched out al the ſlanders they could deuiſe, is encountred, and their bookes intitled <hi>Caluinoturciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and <hi>de Atheiſmis</hi> and <hi>Phalariſmis,</hi> refuted and beaten backe vpon the papiſtes, that in Turkiſh and tyrannicall cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie and contempt of all religion ſurpaſſe all others. If the machiauelian Iebuſite <hi>Parſons</hi> dare oppoſe himſelfe, and will ſay, no: let him anſwere that bóoke. If hee will not anſwere, let him ceaſe to bragge of bookes beaten to duſt and refuted, to the ſhame of him and his conſorts. In this place this may bée ſufficient for auoiding this relators ſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous imputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that thoſe two railing companions obiect other mens faults to vs, and charge vs with priuate mens actes and opinions, which neither the church, nor we particularly allow: and therefore pleade vnſufficiently. But wée charge them with leud opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons held by all the papiſts, and moſt wicked and abominable actions allowed by publike authoritie. Further the papiſtes alleage the teſtimonies of <hi>Lindanus, Staphylus, Cochleus, Reſcius, Reynoldes</hi> and their owne conſorts, fellowes to bée receiued as witneſſes before no indifferent iudge, for their baſeneſſe, leudneſſe and partialitie. But wée are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince them by their owne recordes, and by witneſſes authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, to be ſuch, as they woulde haue vs to bée, and farre
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:177777:251"/> woorſe too. And if <hi>Parſons</hi> maintaine the contrary, hée ſhall ſoone receiue his anſwere, and perceiue his owne inabilitie, and the weakeneſſe of his owne cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Further he obſerueth in <hi>Luther, That at the firſt hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the fathers, and that afterward, when wee began to ſhew how the fathers did witneſſe for our cauſe, that we allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them falſly.</hi> But neither did euer <hi>Luther</hi> contemne all the fathers, but where they ſpoke contrary to the prophets and apoſtles, nor ſhall this counterfeit relator ſhew, that wée haue alleaged the fathers vntruly: as I will bée alwaies readie to iuſtifie againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Hée noteth alſo, <hi>That we make plaine demonſtrations of diſtruſt, in maintaining our cauſe.</hi> And that hée prooueth firſt, <hi>For that diuers bookes written in Engliſh by papiſts, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by proclamation.</hi> Secondly <hi>For that by a ſtatute it was made death to reconcile men, or perſwade them to the Romiſh faith.</hi> Thirdly for that <hi>Streite orders were ſet downe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the reſort of people to the papiſtes, that are priſoners in Wisbich.</hi> But if theſe be arguments of diſtruſt, then are the papiſts moſt diſtruſtfull, and fearefull to haue their matters come in ſcanning. For they forbid all our bookes to be ſolde among them. And if any diſſwade from poperie or talk againſt it, it is preſent death. Neither may any talke with priſoners in the inquiſition. As for our ſelues, we are but too confident in theſe cauſes. For there is no bald louſie friers book commeth forth, but it is commonly ſold in <hi>Paules</hi> church yard, and any learned man may buy any of their bookes publikely. Yea diuers ſimple ſoules not being able to iudge, are often times deceiued by them. So that it were fitting, more care were had in this point. But the true reaſon why our ſuperiours haue forbidden Engliſh bookes, popiſh perſwaſions, and common repaire to popiſh priſoners, is, for that diuers ſimple ſoules not being ſo well able to iudge, haue by ſuch meanes béene drawne not only into leud opinions, but alſo dangerous practiſes, of which we ſhould not offend, if we did take more care, then we do.</p>
                     <p>Finally he noteth, <hi>that we cannot abide confeſſion, ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, reſtitution, or the like:</hi> which is true, if by confeſſion he meane auricular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion made in a prieſts eare, and by ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction ſcourging a mans ſelfe, or walking in pilgrimage, with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:177777:251"/> hope thereby to ſatiſfie God for his ſinnes, and ſuch like ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions: and by reſtitution, ſuch ſummes of money as papiſts are enioyned in lieu of true reſtitution to parties offended, to beſtow vpon prieſts, Iebuſites and notorious traitors. It is not long ſince theſe companions drew from a drie fellow a little before his death two thouſand pounds, with the which the Iebuſites &amp; their conſorts now make merrie. But if order be not taken for ſuch deuiſes to draw mony out of the ſubiects purſes, and to take away theſe means from traitorous practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, the ſame in the end will make this ſtate very ſorrowfull. And therefore I doubt not but the magiſtrates and iudges will looke to that verie diligently. In the meane while I hope I haue taken order with this Relators lying obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                     <p>He doth alſo much abuſe his reader, where he ſaith, <hi>that the tryall will be briefe and eaſie;</hi> and maketh a vaine brag, offering himſelfe to be the champion, that muſt performe the challenge. The firſt is euident, for that they pretend ſo many falſificatious againſt vs, and we haue ſo many falſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations and forgeries to charge our aduerſaries withall, and that moſt iuſtly, that the examination cannot chuſe but prooue long and difficult, eſpecially if they yéeld to vs, that which they demaund themſelues. The ſecond I thinke we ſhall finde true by experience. For it is not <hi>Parſons,</hi> I thinke, that can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all that is offered. Nay, little doth he vnderſtand the galles of his owne cauſe, that once dare obiect forgerie or falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to others. Beſide that, he is fitter to make a clerke to make libels and exhibit petitions, then to make a good diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to iuſtifie the popes broken cauſe. In that he hath ſome prettie facultie: in this we doubt of his abilitie.</p>
                     <p>His other petition is, that ſome one or other would come forth againſt him, and defend biſhop <hi>Iewel, Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>M.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:177777:252"/> grimme countenance alſo, and a Thraſonicall bragge. For I do not thinke that he wil, or dare put his cauſe vpon this trial. Neither do I thinke, that his conſortes will come to an equall examination of all falſifications and coruptions paſſed on both ſides, for the cauſes, that I haue<note n="f" place="margin">

                     <p>Vnto both his petitions, vntill further order be taken, let him receiue this anſwere from me. Firſt, that we very well like of ſuch a triall here, as paſſed lately in France. For as the papiſts found themſelues wronged, or at leaſt pretended to be wronged in <hi>M. Pleſſis</hi> his bookes; ſo we doe ſay, and offer to prooue, that we are wronged, nay that the whole world is wronged and abuſed by millions of forgeries and falſificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons committed by <hi>Bellarmine, Caeſar Baronius, Greg. de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia, Suarez,</hi> and their conſorts, yea by the popes of Rome, whoſe ſentences they hold to be infallible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If then this pratling or rather ſcribling relator, or any of his conſorts do find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe agrieued with this aſſertion and offer, as <hi>M.

Pleſſis</hi> deſired in France.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I do offer my ſelfe partie, &amp; do accept of <hi>Parſons</hi> his challenge, &amp; do offer my ſelf to proue, that thoſe men, whom he challengeth, haue dealt more iuſtly the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar Baronius,</hi> and the reſt of that ſide. Nay, I dare ſimply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them againſt any crimination which this frapling frier hath to lay to their charge. Let him begin when he dare. In the meane while he may do well to anſwere the points dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the firſt chapter of this treatiſe, wherein I haue charged not only priuate men, but the whole ſynagogue of Rome with plaine forging and falſification, and laid downe the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and not as the relator doth, who hauing made a great bragge of falſifications, ſhutteth vp his relation, and iuſtifieth nothing.</p>
                     <p>Somewhat I had more to ſay to <hi>Parſons,</hi> and to his aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, &amp; the whole combination of them. But I reſerue it to ſome other time. By this which alreadie is ſayd, I hope it will appeare, that neither <hi>Iames Peron</hi> hath gained any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:177777:253"/> the Lord of <hi>Pleſſis,</hi> nor <hi>Parſons</hi> hath reaſon to hope, that he ſhall haue better ſucceſſe againſt the Church of England. God which is light &amp; truth grant all chriſtians the light of his grace, that they may not only ſée the truth, but alſo truly iudge what is truth and falſhood.
